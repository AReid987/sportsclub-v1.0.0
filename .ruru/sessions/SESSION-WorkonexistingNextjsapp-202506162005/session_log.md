Error encountered during development: Error evaluating Node.js code. It looks like you're trying to use `tailwindcss` directly as a PostCSS plugin. The PostCSS plugin has moved to a separate package, so to continue using Tailwind CSS with PostCSS you'll need to install `@tailwindcss/postcss` and update your PostCSS configuration.

**Error Encountered (2025-06-17 13:38:27):** Error evaluating Node.js code. The PostCSS plugin for Tailwind CSS has moved to `@tailwindcss/postcss`. To fix this, I need to install the package and update the PostCSS configuration.

**Fix Plan:**
1. Run `pnpm add @tailwindcss/postcss` to install the package.
2. Update `apps/web/postcss.config.mjs` to include `@tailwindcss/postcss` in the plugins array.
