# Task Description

Implement a user authentication system in the existing Next.js application. The system should include user registration, login, and session management functionalities, adhering to best practices for security and usability.

## Goals

- Secure authentication with industry standards (e.g., JWT or OAuth).
- User-friendly interface with clear feedback.
- Seamless integration with the existing Next.js app structure.
- Comprehensive testing to ensure reliability.

## Implementation Steps

1. Research and plan the authentication approach based on project requirements.
2. Develop frontend components using Next.js and React.
3. Build backend API endpoints for authentication logic (using PNPM as per user's custom instructions).
4. Write unit and integration tests for all components.
5. Conduct security reviews and ensure compliance with OWASP guidelines.
6. Deploy and test in the development environment.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Authentication endpoints are functional and secure.
- Frontend components provide a smooth user experience.
- All tests pass without errors.
- Code follows project coding standards and patterns.
- No known vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, CSRF).

## Checklist

- [ ] Design the authentication flow and database schema if needed.
- [ ] Implement user registration endpoint.
- [ ] Implement user login endpoint.
- [ ] Implement user logout functionality.
- [ ] Add session management (e.g., token-based authentication).
- [ ] Create frontend components for login, signup, and profile.
- [ ] Write unit tests for authentication logic.
- [ ] Write integration tests for the entire flow.
- [ ] Perform security reviews and ensure compliance with OWASP guidelines.
- [ ] Deploy and test in the development environment.
- [ ] Update documentation for the authentication system.
