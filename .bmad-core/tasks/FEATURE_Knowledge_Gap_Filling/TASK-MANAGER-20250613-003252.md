# Implement Knowledge Gap Filling Feature

## Description
Implement the Knowledge Gap Filling feature as described in the PRD-PoC.md document. This feature should enable the system to identify missing information, perform web searches, and integrate the results into the knowledge base.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Agent can identify information gaps in product ideas/documents
- [ ] Web search integration implemented
- [ ] Search process/reasoning steps are presented to user
- [ ] Retrieved information is ingested into knowledge base
- [ ] Unit tests for all new functionality
- [ ] Documentation updated with new feature details

## Checklist
- [âœ…] Analyze PRD-PoC.md requirements
    - Identified key requirements:
        * Agent capability to identify information gaps
        * Web search integration
        * Presentation of search process/reasoning
        * Knowledge base ingestion
- [âœ…] Design web search integration architecture
    - Components: Gap Detection, Search API Integration, Reasoning Presentation, Knowledge Base Ingestor
    - Data flow documented in task file
- [âœ…] Implement search capability
- [ ] Add reasoning step presentation
- [ ] Implement knowledge base ingestion
- [ ] Write unit tests
- [ ] Update documentation
## Web Search Integration Architecture Design

### Components:
1. **Gap Detection Module**
   - Analyzes user input and existing knowledge base
   - Identifies missing information or knowledge gaps
   - Generates search queries based on identified gaps

2. **Search API Integration**
   - Interface with external search APIs (e.g., Google, Bing)
   - Handles API authentication and rate limiting
   - Processes search results into structured data

3. **Reasoning Presentation**
   - Tracks search process steps
   - Formats and presents reasoning to user
   - Provides context for search results

4. **Knowledge Base Ingestor**
   - Processes and validates search results
   - Maps results to knowledge base schema
   - Updates knowledge base with new information

### Data Flow:
1. User input â†’ Gap Detection â†’ Search Query
2. Search Query â†’ API Integration â†’ Search Results
3. Search Results â†’ Reasoning Presentation â†’ User
4. Validated Results â†’ Knowledge Base Ingestor â†’ Knowledge Base
### Search API Selection

After evaluating several options, the following search API has been selected:

**API Provider:** Google Programmable Search Engine (PSE)
**Reasons:**
1. Comprehensive web search coverage
2. Customizable search parameters
3. Reasonable pricing for development use
4. Well-documented API
5. Support for structured results

**Implementation Plan:**
1. Create Google PSE account and API key
2. Set up search engine with appropriate filters
3. Implement API integration with rate limiting
4. Add error handling for API responses
5. Configure authentication using API key
