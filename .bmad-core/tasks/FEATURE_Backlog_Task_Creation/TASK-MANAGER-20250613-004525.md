# Backlog & Task Creation Feature

## Description
Implement the Backlog & Task Creation feature as outlined in the PRD-PoC.md document. This feature will convert the developed idea/documents into a structured project backlog, create Epics and breakdown into sequential, sensible Tasks, assign complexity scores, and present the backlog in a Kanban-like view.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Convert product idea/documents into a structured project backlog
- Create Epics and breakdown into sequential, sensible Tasks
- Assign complexity scores (weighted) to tasks/epics
- Present the backlog in a Kanban-like view
- Display up-to-date project progress

## Checklist

## Log
- 2025-06-13 00:51: Created TypeScript interfaces in `apps/web/types.ts` and JSON schema in `apps/web/schemas/backlog.schema.json` to define the backlog structure
- [âœ…] Analyze PRD-PoC.md requirements
    - Key requirements identified:
        1. Convert product idea/documents into structured backlog
        2. Create Epics and breakdown into Tasks
        3. Assign complexity scores
        4. Present backlog in Kanban-like view
        5. Display project progress
- [âœ…] Design backlog structure
- [ ] Implement Epic creation functionality
- [ ] Implement Task breakdown functionality
- [ ] Implement complexity scoring
- [ ] Implement Kanban-like view
- [ ] Implement progress tracking
- [ ] Test and validate functionality
