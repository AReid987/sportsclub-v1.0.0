**Primary Brand Color Recommendation: Electric Blue (#2D5BFF)**

### **Why Electric Blue?**

1. **Trust & Reliability**

    - Blue is universally associated with trust, stability, and professionalism, which aligns with the financial aspect of wallets, cash prizes, and subscriptions.

    - Users need to feel confident their transactions and rewards are secure.

2. **Energy & Competition**

    - Electric blue’s vibrancy adds a dynamic, tech-savvy edge, reflecting the excitement of real-time predictions and leaderboards.

    - It’s less aggressive than red but still energizing, ideal for a competitive gaming environment.

3. **Versatility**

    - Works well in UI/UX design (buttons, gradients, accents) and pairs easily with high-contrast colors like neon green or orange for calls to action.

    - Maintains readability and accessibility on screens.

### **Secondary Color Palette Suggestions**

- **Accent Color:** Vibrant Orange (#FF6B35)

    - Adds urgency for actions like “Place a Bet” or “Subscribe.”

    - Complements blue while injecting playfulness.

- **Neutrals:** Soft Gray (#F5F5F5) and Charcoal (#2A2A2A)

    - Ensure clean, modern interfaces and readability.

- **Success/Error:** Green (#00C853) for wins, Red (#FF1744) for losses.

### **Design & Psychology Rationale**

- **Sports & Competition:** Electric blue evokes the adrenaline of sports (think stadium lighting, jerseys) while feeling less generic than red.

- **Monthly Resets:** Blue’s cyclical connotations (sky, water) subtly reinforce the monthly renewal of wallets.

- **Leaderboards:** Pair with metallic silver/gold accents to highlight rankings and prizes.

### **Competitor Differentiation**

Many betting/gaming apps use red (aggressive) or green (money-focused). Electric blue stands out as innovative and trustworthy, positioning your app as a fresh, reliable choice in a crowded market.

**Final Tip:** Use motion effects (e.g., pulsating blue buttons for predictions) and dynamic gradients to emphasize real-time action!
