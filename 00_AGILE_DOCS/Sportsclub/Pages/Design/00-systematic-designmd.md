## BlackNoir Fundamentals

### Generative Design Systems

> **"In nature nothing is created and nothing is destroyed, but everything is transformed."** - Antoine Laurent Delavosier

### Ideation

2024-12-08

#### Philosophy

- Mathematical Systems, and Systems derived from Nature can be utilized as a guideline for creating design systems which are inherently enjoyable, appealing, and aesthetically pleasing to Users.

- An Intuitive interface can be provided to a user, enabling the co creation of a well-architected #DesignSystem, regardless of their level of Design expertise

- #fibonacci #phi #golden-ratio #AtomicDesignPrinciples

#### Goals

- Develop a system to enable a user to create a #DesignSystem with low friction

- Optimize #UX, reduce time and effort to reach successful output

#### Processes

- Collaborate with an #Agent to generate an #AtomicDesignSystem

- Leverage an #agentic system to guide the user through a series of questions to inform the generation of design tokens

- Results of turns will iteratively generate #AtomicDesign elements

#### Result

- At the conclusion of a session, the partial or completed #DesignSystem will be available for use.

### Visualization

- #Diagrams generated collaboratively with #Khoj

#### 1. Overall System Flow

    C --> E[Typography Scale Generation];
    E --> F[Spatial System Generation];
    F --> G[Atomic Design System Complete];
```

#### 2. Brand Color Selection Process

	A[Questionnaire: Brand Personality, Target Audience, Mission, Values, etc.] --> B(Psychological Color Associations); 
	B --> C["Primary Brand Color Selection (Hex Code Input)"];
```

#### 3. Color Palette Generation

	B --> CP[Complementary] --> C; 
	B --> AG[Analogous] --> C; 
	B --> TT[Tetradic] --> C; 
	B --> SC[Split Complementary] --> C;
```

#### 4. Typography Scale Generation

[[typography-scale-generator-1]]


```text
graph TD 
	A["Input: Base Font Size (px)"] --> B{Mathematical Model Selection}; 
	B -- Fibonacci Sequence --> C["Typography Scale Output (Font Sizes)"]; 
	B -- "Geometric Progression (e.g., \(1.2^n\))" --> C; 
	B -- Modular Scale --> C;
```

#### 5. Spatial System Generation

[[spatial-system-generator-1]]

```text
graph TD
	A["Input: Base Spacing Unit (px)"] --> B{Mathematical Model Selection};
	B -- Fibonacci Sequence --> C["Spatial System Output (Spacing Units)"]; 
	B -- Modular Scale --> C; 
	B -- Golden Ratio --> C;
```

### Mathematical Models and Formulas

#### Golden Ratio:

- ( \phi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \approx 1.618 )

- This ratio can be used to create harmonious proportions in #colorPalettes and #spatialSystems.

- For color generation, you could use it to determine the luminance or saturation differences between colors.

- For spacing, it can define the ratio between different spacing units.

#### Fibonacci Sequence:

- (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...)

- Each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.

- This sequence can be used to create visually pleasing scales for #typography and #spacing.

- For example, font sizes could be based on Fibonacci numbers.

#### Geometric Progression:

- (a, ar, ar^2, ar^3, ...)

- where (a) is the first term and (r) is the common ratio.

- This can be used to create a smooth, visually consistent #typography scale.

- A common ratio of around 1.2 is often used.

#### Modular Scale:

- A system for creating harmonious scales based on a base unit and a ratio.

- It's often used for #typography and #spacing.

- Various ratios can be used, including the #GoldenRatio or other aesthetically pleasing ratios.

#### - Triadic Harmony: 

- A color scheme using three colors evenly spaced around the color wheel.

#### Complementary Colors:

- Colors opposite each other on the color wheel.

#### Analogous Colors:

- Colors adjacent to each other on the color wheel.

#### Tetradic Harmony:

- A color scheme using four colors, two pairs of complementary colors.

#### Split Complementary:

- A color scheme using a base color and the two colors adjacent to its complement.

### User Interface (UI) Design:**

#### Questionnaire:

- The questionnaire will be the core of the application. It will use a combination of question types, including:

    - Multiple-choice questions (radio buttons, checkboxes)

    - Rating scales (e.g., 1-5 stars, Likert scales)

    - Open-ended questions (text fields)

    - Color pickers (allowing users to select their preferred colors)

    - File uploads (for logos, mood boards, etc.)

#### Layout: 

- The layout will follow best practices for online questionnaires:

    - Clear and concise questions, avoiding jargon.

    - Logical grouping of questions into sections.

    - Progress indicators to show the user's progress.

    - Responsive design to adapt to different screen sizes.

    - Real-time validation to provide immediate feedback on user input.

    - Confirmation messages after each section or the entire questionnaire.

#### Feedback Mechanisms:

#### Real-time validation:

- Error messages will appear immediately if the user enters invalid data.

#### Progress indicators:

- A progress bar will show the user how far they are through the questionnaire.

#### Confirmation messages:

- A confirmation message will appear after each section or the entire questionnaire is completed.

#### Conditional Logic: 

- The questionnaire will use conditional logic to dynamically adjust the questions based on the user's previous answers.

- This will ensure that only relevant questions are asked, improving the user experience and efficiency.

#### Color Selection:

- The app will include color pickers that allow users to select colors directly, or it will suggest colors based on their answers.

- The color pickers should support hex codes, RGB, and HSL values.

### II. Mathematical Models and Algorithms

- The system will automatically select the most appropriate mathematical model based on the user's responses to the questionnaire.

- This selection will be handled behind the scenes, without requiring the user to make any choices.

- The models will include:

#### Color Palette Generation

- Golden Ratio

- Triadic Harmony

- Complementary Colors

- Analogous Colors

- Tetradic Harmony

- Split Complementary

#### Typography Scale Generation

- Fibonacci Sequence

- Geometric Progression

- Modular Scale

#### Spatial System Generation

- Fibonacci Sequence

- Modular Scale

- Golden Ratio

### III. Design Token Generation and Output

#### Color Palettes

- Primary, secondary, accent, and neutral palettes

- expressed in hex, RGB, HSL, and design tokens

- following best practices from sources like Tokens Studio and Google Material 3

#### Typography Scales

- A range of font sizes based on the chosen mathematical model.

#### Spatial Systems

- A set of spacing units for consistent spacing throughout the design.

#### Output Formats

#### Downloadable files:

- The design system will be available for download in various formats (e.g., JSON, CSS, SCSS).

#### Embedded preview:

- A preview of the generated design system will be displayed within the web app.

#### Micro-frontend:

- The generated design system could be packaged as a micro-frontend for easy integration into other applications.

#### Storybook:

- A Storybook project could be generated to showcase the components of the design system.

#### Supernova:

- A Supernova project could be generated to further streamline the design system's implementation.

### IV. Technology Stack

#### Frontend

- React, Next.js (or similar framework)

#### Backend

- #Nodejs, Express (or similar framework)

#### Database

- MongoDB (or similar NoSQL database)

### V. Implementation Steps

#### Questionnaire Design

- We need to create a detailed questionnaire with specific questions and question types.

- This will require further research into best practices for brand information gathering.

#### Algorithm Implementation

- The algorithms for generating color palettes, typography scales, and spacing systems need to be implemented.

#### Design Token Management

- A system for managing and organizing design tokens needs to be developed.

#### UI/UX Prototyping

## Systematic Brand Color Palettes

Once you have a primary brand color, you can use several methods to generate a harmonious color palette using these color schemes

- Golden Ratio

- Triadic Harmony

- Complementary Colors

- Tetradic Harmony

- Split Complementary

The methods below assume you're working in a color space like

- HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness)

- HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value)
which are better suited for these calculations than RGB.
Many online tools and libraries allow you to convert between color spaces.

### **I. Using a Color Wheel and Color Harmony Rules:**

- This is the most intuitive approach.

- Most online color palette generators

    - (like those listed in the previous internet data)

    - allow you to select a color harmony rule

    - automatically generate the remaining colors.

#### 1. **Input your primary color:** 

- Enter primary brand color's values into color palette generator.

    - hex code

    - RGB

    - HSL values

#### 2. **Select the desired harmony:** 

- Choose the harmony rule from the generator's options

    - Triadic

    - Complementary

    - Tetradic

    - Split Complementary

- The generator will

    - calculate and display other colors in the palette

    - based on the selected harmony rule.

### **II. Manual Calculation (More Advanced):**

- This approach requires

    - understanding color theory

    - some mathematical calculations.

- It's best done with programming or a spreadsheet.

#### **A. Triadic Harmony:**

- A triadic harmony uses three colors evenly spaced around the color wheel

- 120 degrees apart

#### 1. **Determine the hue:** 

- Find the hue of your primary color (H in HSL or HSV).

#### 2. **Calculate the other hues:** 

- Add 120 and 240 degrees to the primary hue.

- If the result exceeds 360, subtract 360.

- This gives you the hues of the other two colors.

#### 3. **Adjust saturation and lightness/value:** 

- You can adjust all three colors fine-tune the palette

    - saturation (S)

    - lightness/value (L/V)

    - Keep the saturation relatively consistent for a balanced palette.

#### **B. Complementary Colors:**

- Directly opposite each other on the color wheel

- 180 degrees apart).

#### 1. **Determine the hue:**

- Find the hue of your primary color.

#### 2. **Calculate the complementary hue:** 

- Add 180 degrees to the primary hue.

- If the result exceeds 360, subtract 360.

#### 3. **Adjust saturation and lightness/value:**

- Adjust S and L/V as needed.

#### **C. Tetradic Harmony:**

- A tetradic harmony uses four colors, two complementary pairs.

#### 1. **Find the complementary hue:** 

- As in the complementary color method

- find the hue 180 degrees from your primary color.

#### 2. **Find adjacent colors:** 

- Find hues 90 degrees away from primary and complementary hues.

- This will give you four colors forming two complementary pairs.

#### 3. **Adjust saturation and lightness/value:** 

- Adjust S and L/V as needed.

#### **D. Split Complementary Colors:**

- A split-complementary palette uses the primary color and the two colors adjacent to its complement.

#### 1. **Find the complementary hue:** 

- As in the complementary color method,

- find the hue 180 degrees from your primary color.

#### 2. **Find adjacent colors:** 

- Find the hues 30 degrees on either side of the complementary hue.

- This gives you three colors.

#### 3. **Adjust saturation and lightness/value:** 

- Adjust S and L/V as needed.

#### **E. Applying the Golden Ratio:**

- The Golden Ratio (approximately 1.618)

- can be applied in several ways:

#### 1. **Hue Spacing:** 

- Instead of fixed intervals (120, 180 degrees)

- use the Golden Ratio to determine the spacing between hues.

- This is more complex and requires iterative calculations.

#### 2. **Saturation/Lightness/Value Ratios:** 

- Use the Golden Ratio to determine the ratios of

    - saturation and lightness/value

    - between colors in your palette.

- For example, you might have a

    - primary color with 100% saturation

    - a secondary color with 61.8% saturation (100/1.618)

    - and a tertiary color with 38.2% saturation (61.8/1.618).

### **III. Using Software/Libraries:**

- Many programming languages have libraries that handle

    - color manipulation

    - color harmony calculations.

- These libraries can simplify the process significantly.

- For example, in JavaScript, you could use a library like chroma.js.

#### **Example (Conceptual using JavaScript and chroma.js):**

- This is a simplified example and would need adaptation

- based on your specific needs and the chosen library.

```javascript
// Assuming you have your primary color in hex format
const primaryColorHex = '#FF6347'; // Tomato
// Using chroma.js (you'll need to include the library)
const primaryColor = chroma(primaryColorHex);
// Complementary color
const complementaryColor = primaryColor.complement();
// Triadic colors (simplified - you might need more precise calculations)
const triadicColor1 = primaryColor.rotate(120);
const triadicColor2 = primaryColor.rotate(240);
// Output the hex codes
console.log("Primary:", primaryColor.hex());
console.log("Complementary:", complementaryColor.hex());
console.log("Triadic 1:", triadicColor1.hex());
console.log("Triadic 2:", triadicColor2.hex());
// ... similar calculations for tetradic and split complementary ...
```

- adjust saturation and lightness/value to achieve the desired aesthetic.
