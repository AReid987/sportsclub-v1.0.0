Okay, Antonio, that's clear. I'll now integrate the details for the **Component Library / Design System Approach** into the `front-end-spec.md` document.

Here's how that section will look:

## 3. Component Library / Design System Reference

Sportsclub will leverage **Radix UI** as its foundational headless component library, providing accessible and unstyled primitives for UI components. **Tailwind CSS** will be used for styling, enabling a utility-first approach to build our custom design system. The combination of these tools will allow for the efficient creation of highly customizable, reusable, and accessible UI components.

## 4. Branding & Style Guide Reference

This section outlines the foundational branding and style guidelines for Sportsclub. Detailed specifications for all visual elements will reside in the primary design files (Figma).

- **Link to Primary Design Files:** {e.g., Figma URL - *to be added once created*}

- **Color Palette:** A red theme, drawing inspiration from "red 9 from Radix UI" and the red theme examples on the Radix UI website, will serve as the preferred starting point for the primary color palette.

- **Typography:** Typography choices will align with a modern, clean, and action-oriented aesthetic, ensuring readability and visual hierarchy. Specific font families, sizes, and weights will be detailed in the primary design files.

- **Iconography:** Iconography will be clear, minimalist, and consistent, supporting the "Intuitive & Effortless" experience. The icon set and usage notes will be defined in the primary design files.

- **Visual Style:** The design will incorporate sharp angles and may explore grainy and metallic textures to evoke feelings of excitement, competition, fun, and success.

- **Tagline Exploration:** The tagline "Play Smart. Win Big" is being considered to capture the essence of the platform.

- **Spacing & Grid:** A consistent spacing and grid system will be implemented to ensure visual balance, organization, and responsiveness across all layouts.

## Responsiveness

- Sportsclub is designed as a **mobile-first responsive web application**, ensuring an optimal user experience across a range of devices, including smartphones, tablets, and desktop computers.

- **Breakpoints:** The design will adapt to the following primary breakpoints, which will be defined in pixels within the styling framework (e.g., Tailwind CSS configuration):

    - **Mobile (Default):** For screens up to approximately `640px` wide. This will be the base design.

    - **Tablet (Medium):** For screens from `641px` to `1024px` wide.

    - **Desktop (Large):** For screens wider than `1024px`.

- **Adaptation Strategy:**

    - **Mobile-First Design:** All components and layouts will be designed and built with mobile screens as the primary consideration, ensuring core functionality and readability on smaller devices.

    - **Fluid Grids & Flexible Images:** The layout will utilize fluid grids and flexible images to adapt gracefully to varying screen widths.

    - **Content Prioritization:** On smaller screens, content will be prioritized to ensure critical information and actions are easily accessible, potentially reflowing or hiding less essential elements.

    - **Navigation Adaptation:** Navigation elements will adapt to the breakpoint (e.g., bottom tab bar on mobile, sidebar on desktop, as discussed in Information Architecture).

    - **Component Behavior:** UI components will adjust their size, layout, and interaction patterns as appropriate for each breakpoint to maintain usability and visual appeal.
