## Goal, Objective and Context

### **Goal (Final Draft):** 

- To provide a uniquely engaging, low-risk, and affordable platform where sports enthusiasts can enjoy prediction games; 

    - develop skills in predictive analysis through an AI assistant that offers 

        - tutoring, data visualization, and personalized monthly performance reviews; 

    - compete for real prizes; 

    - and actively participate in a vibrant community stimulated by both user and AI agent interactions 

        - (e.g., discussions, agent-led trivia and activities), 

    - featuring relevant news and live event integration. 

    - These elements, powered by a monthly subscription, will serve as key differentiators.

###  **Objective** 

#### (Initial MVP Focus) (Final Draft): 

#### To launch a comprehensive web application (MVP) enabling users to:

1. Sign up, undergo ID verification, and manage their accounts 

    - (including setting username, uploading avatars, and password recovery).

2. Manage a monthly subscription.

3. Receive a virtual wallet credited with a set amount of virtual coins 

    - (e.g., 50,000) on the first of each month.

4. Use these coins (in specified increments, e.g., 1,000) 

    - to predict the winners of a variety of available upcoming **major sporting events** 

        - (those with available odds commencing within the month).

5. Receive virtual coins based on correct predictions, calculated as (coins placed * odds).

6. View their accumulated coin totals on a real-time leaderboard.

7. Compete for cash prizes awarded to top-ranking players at the end of each month, 

    - after which all player wallets reset for the next monthly cycle.

8. Access an AI agent assistant for:

    - Answering sports-related questions 

        - (excluding direct pick suggestions).

    - Generative UI functionality for visualizing statistics and data 

        - (e.g., team trends, personal/other player performance).

    - Guidance on which data is important to scrutinize and analyze 

        - (tutoring aspect).

    - Reviewing their past month's prediction performance 

        - and helping them strategize for improvement.

9. Access **relevant sports news through features like a breaking news/highlight ticker** 

    - and a feed of articles related to upcoming events and analysis.

10. Engage with community features, 

    - including a Reddit-like forum and real-time chat functionality during live sporting events 

        - (with real-time scores), 

        - **with AI agents contributing to moderation and facilitating engaging activities** 

            - (e.g., discussions, trivia).

11. Benefit from gamification elements such as 

    - daily bonus coins, 

    - login streak bonuses, 

    - prediction win streak bonuses, 

    - **and community challenges/activities** 

        - (potentially agent-led) for bonus coins.

### **Context (Revised):** 

- The concept for Sportsclub was initiated by cofounder Chris, 

    - with Antonio (the Coder) driving its development. 

- The primary motivation is to offer a 

    - **feature-rich**, 

    - cost-effective, 

    - and multifaceted alternative to traditional sports betting. 

- Sportsclub aims to combine the excitement of sports prediction with opportunities for users to

    - learn about data science and predictive analysis, 

    - satisfy their competitive spirit, 

    - and enjoy robust community interaction, 

- all within a single subscription fee.

## Non Functional Requirements (MVP)

### **A. Performance Requirements:**

#### **Response Times:**

- The system SHOULD provide a responsive user experience, with most common user actions

    - (e.g., loading pages/views, submitting predictions, interacting with the AI assistant)

    - completing within a general target of 2-3 seconds under typical load conditions.

- Real-time features like leaderboard updates and live chat 

    - SHOULD update with minimal perceptible delay.

#### **Capacity & Scalability:**

- The system architecture MUST be designed with scalability in mind 

    - to support growth towards hundreds of thousands of concurrent users in future iterations.

- For the MVP launch, the system MUST be able to smoothly handle an initial target load of 

    - [e.g., 1,000-5,000, TBD during technical design] 

    - concurrent users during peak times 

        - (e.g., during major sporting events), 

    - with clear paths to scale further. 

- We should aim for the highest number of users feasible 

    - for a successful MVP launch and beyond.

#### **Load Handling:**

- The system MUST utilize autoscaling mechanisms where feasible 

    - to adjust resources optimally based on demand, 

    - ensuring performance and stability under varying load conditions.

- Under extreme load exceeding planned capacity, 

    - the system SHOULD degrade gracefully 

        - (e.g., potentially prioritizing core prediction features over less critical background tasks) 

        - rather than failing entirely.

### **B. Security & Compliance:**

#### **Data Protection:**

- All user data, especially Personally Identifiable Information (PII) 

    - collected during sign-up (including age and address) 

    - and ID verification (including submitted documents), 

    - and financial data for subscriptions, 

        - MUST be stored securely.

- Sensitive data MUST be encrypted at rest and in transit using strong encryption standards.

- All data handling practices MUST comply with relevant data protection regulations 

    - in the jurisdictions Sportsclub operates in 

        - (e.g., GDPR, CCPA, depending on target user locations). 

    - User consent for data processing will be managed transparently.

#### **Authentication & Authorization:**

- Authentication mechanisms (password-based and OAuth) MUST be secure, 

    - implementing best practices to protect against common vulnerabilities 

        - (e.g., brute-force attacks, credential stuffing).

- Authorization rules MUST be strictly enforced to ensure 

    - users can only access data and features appropriate to their 

        - verified status, 

        - subscription level, 

        - and roles.

#### **Regulatory Compliance:**

- The platform MUST be designed, developed, and operated in full compliance with 

    - This includes, but is not limited to, regulations concerning:

        - Skill-based contests and fantasy sports (as the platform is positioned ).

        - Cash prize offerings and payouts.

        - Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) requirements

            - associated with ID verification and financial transactions.

        - Data privacy and consumer protection.

        - all applicable laws and regulations in its target jurisdictions. 

- The platform will need to adhere to licensing requirements for 

    - fantasy sports or skill-based games as necessary in each jurisdiction.

#### **Privacy by Design:**

- User privacy will be a core consideration. 

    - While no additional specific principles were noted at this stage 

        - beyond standard data privacy laws, 

        - the system will be designed with privacy by default 

            - (e.g., clear policies, 

            - user control over shareable information where applicable, 

            - considerations for AI data usage).

### **C. Reliability & Resilience:**

#### **Availability (Uptime):**

- The Sportsclub platform SHOULD target a high level of availability, 

    - aiming for at least 99.5% uptime for core user-facing services 

    - and functionalities during the MVP phase.

- Critical periods, such as during popular live sporting events 

    - and month-end leaderboard finalization/prize processing, 

    - require heightened monitoring 

    - and effort to ensure maximum availability.

#### **Backup and Recovery:**

- All critical data, including user accounts, 

    - PII, subscription status, 

    - virtual wallet balances, 

    - transaction histories, 

    - prediction data, 

    - and application configurations, 

    - MUST be backed up regularly and automatically.

- For MVP, the target Recovery Time Objective (RTO) in case of a major system failure 

    - SHOULD be less than 4 hours.

- For MVP, the target Recovery Point Objective (RPO), 

    - representing acceptable data loss, SHOULD be less than 1 hour.

#### **Fault Tolerance:**

- The system MUST be designed to be resilient to individual component failures. 

    - Where feasible for MVP, critical services should incorporate redundancy.

- Failure of a non-critical component (e.g., a specific news feed update mechanism) 

    - SHOULD NOT cascade to bring down core platform functionality 

        - (e.g., predictions, account access, leaderboard). 

    - The system should degrade gracefully where possible.

### **D. Technical Constraints & Considerations:**

#### **Platform/Technology Stack:**

- The specific technology stack 

    - (languages, frameworks, databases) 

    - will be determined during the detailed architectural design phase.

- The chosen stack MUST prioritize modern, scalable, secure, and maintainable technologies

    - suitable for a feature-rich web application with 

        - real-time components, 

        - AI-driven features, 

        - and a mobile-first responsive design.

- A cloud-native approach, leveraging managed cloud services 

    - (e.g., from AWS, GCP, or Azure as suggested in research), 

    - is preferred for infrastructure to facilitate scalability and reliability.

#### **Integration with Third-Party Services:**

- Integrations with all third-party services 

    - (including payment gateways like Stripe/PayPal, 

    - ID verification services, 

    - data source APIs for odds/scores/news, 

    - AI/LLM services, 

    - and notification services)

        - to maintain quality and address accrued technical debt.

    - Post-MVP, a portion of development capacity should be considered 

        - for managing technical debt and continuous improvement of the codebase.

### Critical Deficiencies

- None identified.

### Recommendations

#### **Technical Terms Definition:** 

- While efforts were made to minimize jargon, 

- it's recommended that any highly technical terms within the PRD 

    - that a non-developer stakeholder might not understand 

    - be explicitly defined or explained, 

    - or that such stakeholders are briefed separately.

#### **Detailed Diagrams:** 

- Encourage the Design Architect and Architect to produce comprehensive visual diagrams 

    - (e.g., site maps, user flows, component diagrams, architectural overviews) 

    - in their respective documentation, 

    - which can then be referenced or summarized in the PRD for enhanced clarity.

#### **Specific KPI Benchmarks:** 

- As the project progresses, define specific numerical targets and benchmarks 

    - for the identified KPIs 

    - (e.g., "Achieve 1000 active subscribers in first 3 months")

    -  to enable more precise MVP success measurement.

#### **Refined TBDs:** 

- Continue to refine and define all "TBD" (To Be Determined) items 

    - noted throughout the PRD 

    - (e.g., specific gamification amounts, 

    - prize formulas, 

    - detailed moderation processes) 

    - during subsequent architectural and planning phases.

#### **Formal Dependency Mapping:** 

- Although implicit dependencies were discussed, 

- formal documentation of all major dependencies between functional areas/Epics 

    - (e.g., using a dependency graph or table) 

- should be a follow-up task to ensure a clear development roadmap.

## Final Decision

### **READY FOR ARCHITECT**: 

- The PRD and epics are comprehensive, properly structured, and ready for architectural design.
