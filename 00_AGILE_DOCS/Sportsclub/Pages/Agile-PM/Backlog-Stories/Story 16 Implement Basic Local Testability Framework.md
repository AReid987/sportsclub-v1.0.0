# Story 1.6: Implement Basic Local Testability Framework

# Story 1.6: Implement Basic Local Testability Framework

## Status: Draft

## Story

- As a **developer**,

- I want to **implement a basic framework for local testability of initial components**,

- so that **developers can efficiently write and run unit tests for foundational code, ensuring early quality and enabling iterative development.**

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. A testing framework (e.g., Jest for TypeScript/JavaScript, PyTest for Python) is integrated into the monorepo for relevant packages (e.g., `web`, `auth-service`).

2. Configuration for running unit tests locally is set up for both frontend and backend packages.

3. A simple example unit test is created for a basic utility function or component in both `web` and `auth-service` packages.

4. The example unit tests successfully pass when run locally using the configured framework.

5. Test scripts are added to `package.json` (root or relevant package) for easy execution of tests.

6. Test file organization (e.g., `*.test.ts`, `test_*.py` co-located or in `__tests__/`) adheres to the "Overall Testing Strategy" in the Architecture Document.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Install and configure testing framework (Jest/Vitest for TS/JS, PyTest for Python) in relevant packages.

- [ ] Set up test configurations (e.g., `jest.config.js`, `pytest.ini`).

- [ ] Create a simple utility function (e.g., `add.ts`, `math.py`) in `web` and `auth-service` if none suitable exists.

- [ ] Write a basic unit test for the utility function in each package.

- [ ] Run local tests to ensure they pass.

- [ ] Add `test` scripts to `package.json` for easy test execution.

- [ ] Verify test file organization.

## Dev Technical Guidance

This story establishes the basic unit testing infrastructure, which is vital for developer productivity and code quality from day one.

- **Dependency:** This story **depends on Story 1.1: Establish Project Repositories and Monorepo Structure** for the monorepo setup, and implicitly on **Story 1.5: Document Local Development Environment Setup** to ensure the local environment is functional.

- **Testing Tools:** Refer to the "Definitive Tech Stack Selections" in the Architecture Document for general preferences. For this story, choose Jest/Vitest for TypeScript/JavaScript and PyTest for Python.

- **Test File Organization:** Adhere strictly to the "Unit Test File Organization" specified in the "Overall Testing Strategy" section of the Architecture Document.

- **Monorepo Integration:** Ensure the testing framework works correctly within the Turborepo monorepo context.

- **Test Data:** For these initial unit tests, simple in-memory data should be sufficient; no complex test data management is required yet.

- **Verification:** A successful completion means developers can reliably write and execute unit tests locally for foundational code.
