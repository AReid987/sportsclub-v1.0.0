# Story 5.2: Implement AI Assistant Q&A Functionality

# Story 5.2: Implement AI Assistant Q&A Functionality

## Status: Draft

## Story

- As a **Sportsclub user**,

- I want to **ask the AI assistant sports-related questions and receive accurate answers**,

- so that I can **quickly get information and enhance my sports knowledge.**

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. The AI assistant can receive text input from users for sports-related questions.

2. The AI assistant provides factual information, educational content, and statistical analysis in its responses.

3. The AI assistant explicitly does NOT provide direct predictions, betting advice, or tell users which teams/outcomes to pick.

4. Users can interact with the AI assistant via a dedicated text input interface (UI).

5. *(Future AC: Users can interact with the AI assistant via voice input. - This could be a separate story if complex).*

6. AI assistant responses are quick and relevant to the query.

7. The AI assistant responses adhere to the specified content strategy (factual, educational, analytical).

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Implement frontend UI for AI assistant text input and response display.

- [ ] Implement frontend logic to send user queries to the AI Assistant Service.

- [ ] Implement backend API endpoint in AI Assistant Service to receive user queries.

- [ ] Implement backend logic within AI Assistant Service to process queries using the integrated LLM and knowledge graph.

- [ ] Implement logic to ensure AI responses adhere to content guidelines (no predictions/betting advice).

- [ ] Utilize caching mechanism (Portkey) for frequent or identical queries.

- [ ] Ensure AI responses are returned efficiently to the frontend.

- [ ] Log AI assistant interactions for monitoring and improvement.

## Dev Technical Guidance

This story brings the AI Assistant to life with its core Q&A functionality. Focus on accurate information retrieval, adherence to content guidelines, and performance.

- **Dependency:** This story **depends on Story 5.1: Set up Core AI Assistant Backend Infrastructure** (for LLM integration, caching, knowledge graph). It also depends on **Epic 1** for foundational setup.

- **AI Assistant Service:** This story primarily involves developing within the `ai-assistant-service` microservice.

- **LLM Interaction:** Leverage the LLM integration set up in Story 5.1. Focus on prompt engineering to guide the LLM's responses towards factual, educational, and analytical content, and explicitly away from prediction/betting advice.

- **Knowledge Graph (KG):** Utilize the initial knowledge graph (from Story 5.1) to retrieve relevant facts for answering queries where applicable.

- **Caching:** Ensure the prompt/response caching (Portkey) is actively used to reduce latency and cost for repeated queries.

- **Content Strategy:** The specific curriculum and knowledge base for the AI's Q&A role (as noted in PRD) needs to be continually refined. The AI should avoid sports predictions (as per PRD 5.a.iii).

- **API Design:** Design a clear API endpoint for submitting queries and receiving responses.

- **Performance:** Optimize the response time of the AI assistant to be quick and relevant.

- **Security:** Implement input sanitization to prevent prompt injection vulnerabilities. Ensure sensitive information is not exposed in responses.

- **Testing Guidance:**

    - **Approach:** Unit tests for prompt engineering logic, content adherence rules, and caching effectiveness. Integration tests for end-to-end query processing (frontend -> AI service -> LLM/KG -> response). Manual testing for factual accuracy, relevance, and adherence to "no prediction" rule.

    - **Special Considerations:** Rigorous testing for prompt injection. Verify that AI responses are consistently factual and educational, and *never* provide betting advice. Performance testing for response latency, especially with/without cache hits.
