# Story 2.3: Create Virtual Wallet and Display Balance

# Story 2.3: Create Virtual Wallet and Display Balance

## Status: Draft

## Story

- As a **Sportsclub user**,

- I want a **virtual wallet to be created for my account and display my current coin balance**,

- so that I can **understand my economic standing and prepare to make predictions.**

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. A virtual wallet is automatically created for a user upon successful sign-up (after ID verification and initial subscription, if applicable).

2. The user's virtual wallet is accessible via a dedicated interface within the application.

3. The wallet interface prominently displays the user's current virtual coin balance.

4. The current coin balance accurately reflects all coin distributions, predictions placed, and winnings awarded.

5. *(Future AC: A transaction history of coin movements will be available within the wallet interface. - This could be a separate story if complex).*

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Implement backend logic for automatic virtual wallet creation upon user sign-up completion.

- [ ] Design and implement the dedicated virtual wallet UI (e.g., a "Wallet" page or a prominent section on the dashboard).

- [ ] Implement frontend and backend logic to display the current virtual coin balance.

- [ ] Ensure the displayed balance updates in real-time or near real-time as transactions occur (e.g., from prediction outcomes or coin distributions).

- [ ] (Consider placeholder for transaction history display, to be fully implemented in a future story).

## Dev Technical Guidance

This story establishes the core economic unit for users. Focus on data accuracy, real-time updates for balance, and secure handling of coin data.

- **Dependency:** This story **depends on Epic 1** being completed (User Foundation & Onboarding, including ID verification). It also relies on **Story 2.1: Implement Subscription Purchase and Management** to ensure users are subscribed and **Story 1.4: Set up Initial Database Instance and Schema** for wallet data persistence.

- **Data Models:** Refer to the `VirtualWallet` and `User` data models in the Architecture Document for schema definitions.

- **Database Interactions:** Ensure secure and efficient read/write operations for wallet balances.

- **Real-time Considerations:** While real-time updates are a general NFR, for the wallet balance display, ensure the chosen approach (e.g., polling, WebSockets if part of a broader real-time push) supports near real-time accuracy.

- **Security:** Implement robust security measures to prevent tampering with coin balances. Adhere to "Security Best Practices" in the Architecture Document for data integrity and access control.
