# Story 6.2: Develop a Dedicated News Feed & Articles Page

# Story 6.2: Develop a Dedicated News Feed & Articles Page

## Status: Draft

## Story

- As a **Sportsclub user**,

- I want to **access a dedicated page for a feed of news articles and other informational content**,

- so that I can **browse, search, and read full articles to stay informed and learn.**

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. The system provides a dedicated page for users to browse a feed of news articles and other informational content.

2. The news feed presents content in a "cards" layout, with each card displaying a headline, a brief summary, and a relevant image.

3. Users can click on a news card to view the full article content.

4. Full article content is hosted and displayed within the Sportsclub platform.

5. Users can filter the news articles/content (e.g., by sport, keywords, content type).

6. Users can search the news articles/content.

7. The content available in this feed includes: pre-game analysis, post-game analysis, and educational articles/materials related to data science and predictive analysis.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Implement backend API endpoint for fetching news feed content (articles, analyses, educational materials).

- [ ] Implement frontend dedicated news page UI.

- [ ] Implement frontend UI component for displaying news content in a "cards" layout (headline, summary, image).

- [ ] Implement frontend logic for handling clicks on news cards to display full article content.

- [ ] Implement frontend UI for displaying full article content within the platform.

- [ ] Implement frontend and backend logic for filtering news content (by sport, keywords, content type).

- [ ] Implement frontend and backend logic for searching news content.

- [ ] Integrate with the Content Service to source news articles and other informational content.

- [ ] Ensure proper display of various content types (news, pre-game, post-game, educational).

## Dev Technical Guidance

This story focuses on providing a rich, browsable content experience. Ensure robust data retrieval, efficient rendering of content, and comprehensive search/filter capabilities.

- **Dependency:** This story **depends on Epic 1** for foundational setup. It also relies heavily on the **Content Service** (from Component View in Architecture Document) for sourcing, storing, and delivering content.

- **Data Sourcing:** News articles and other informational content will be sourced and managed by the **Content Service**. The "External Data Scraping Sources (Agent-Powered)" in the Architecture Document's "API Reference" outlines the mechanisms for data acquisition.

- **Data Models:** Refer to the `NewsArticle` data model in the Architecture Document for schema definitions, particularly noting `articleType` and `fullContent`.

- **API Design:** The backend API endpoint for the news feed should support pagination and filtering parameters to optimize performance for large content libraries.

- **Performance:** Optimize frontend rendering for potentially large amounts of content in the feed. Ensure fast loading times for full articles, possibly leveraging client-side caching. Refer to "Performance Requirements" in NFRs (PRD).

- **Search & Filtering:** The implementation should consider efficient database queries and indexing for keywords and content types.

- **UI/UX:** The "cards" layout should be visually appealing and responsive, aligning with the UI/UX Specification. Ensure a clear and intuitive design for search and filter controls.

- **Accessibility:** Ensure the news feed and article display are accessible, with proper semantic HTML and keyboard navigation. Refer to "Accessibility (AX) Requirements" in the UI/UX Specification.
