# Story 7.2: Provide Real-Time Chat during Live Events

# Story 7.2: Provide Real-Time Chat during Live Events

## Status: Draft

## Story

- As a **Sportsclub user**,

- I want to **participate in real-time chat rooms for live sporting events and see real-time scores**,

- so that I can **engage with other users and stay updated during the game.**

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. The system provides dedicated real-time chat rooms associated with specific live sporting events.

2. Users can access these live event chat rooms from multiple points in the application, including:

    - A dedicated "Live Events" page.

    - Links or indicators on the leaderboard page for games that are currently live.

    - A "live games feed" section on the user's profile page.

3. Within a live chat room, users can:

    - Send and receive text messages in real-time.

    - Use reactions (e.g., emojis) on messages.

    - View a list of other currently active participants in the chat room.

4. Real-time scores and key event updates for the associated live sporting event are displayed within or alongside the chat interface.

5. The AI assistant participates in live event chats by:

    - Providing automated moderation (e.g., filtering inappropriate language, flagging issues).

    - Answering general event-related questions (e.g., rules, current game state facts).

    - Posting automated event updates, highlights, or interesting statistics.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Implement backend WebSocket server for real-time chat functionality.

- [ ] Implement backend API endpoints for chat message persistence and retrieval.

- [ ] Implement backend logic for associating chat rooms with specific live sporting events.

- [ ] Implement frontend UI for displaying dedicated live event chat rooms.

- [ ] Implement frontend WebSocket client for sending and receiving chat messages in real-time.

- [ ] Implement frontend UI for sending text messages and emoji reactions.

- [ ] Implement frontend UI for displaying a list of active chat participants.

- [ ] Integrate with **Data Ingestion & Validation Service** to source real-time scores and event updates for display in chat.

- [ ] Implement backend integration with the **Community Service** for chat persistence and potentially user list management.

- [ ] Implement backend integration with the **AI Assistant Service** for AI moderation and participation in chat.

- [ ] Implement AI logic for filtering inappropriate content and flagging issues.

- [ ] Implement AI logic for answering general event-related questions in chat.

- [ ] Implement AI logic for posting automated event updates, highlights, or statistics in chat.

- [ ] Ensure secure handling of chat messages and user interactions.

## Dev Technical Guidance

This story is highly focused on real-time communication and AI integration. Prioritize low-latency message delivery, efficient WebSocket handling, and robust AI responses within the chat context.

- **Dependency:** This story **depends on Epic 1** for foundational setup (user accounts, basic infrastructure). It also relies on the **Community Service** for chat functionality, the **AI Assistant Service** for AI participation and moderation, and the **Data Ingestion & Validation Service** for real-time scores (all from Component View in Architecture Document).

- **Real-time Communication:** WebSockets (e.g., using Socket.IO) are the chosen technology for real-time communication for leaderboards and live chat, as specified in the "Definitive Tech Stack Selections" of the Architecture Document.

- **Data Models:** Refer to the `ChatMessage`, `SportingEvent`, and `User` data models in the Architecture Document for schema definitions.

- **API Design:** Design efficient WebSocket message formats and RESTful API endpoints for chat history retrieval.

- **AI Integration:** The AI Assistant's role here involves real-time moderation, answering questions, and posting updates. Ensure AI responses are quick, relevant, and adhere to "AI Assistant Q&A Guidelines" (PRD 5.a.iii).

- **Data Sourcing (Real-time Scores):** Leverage the **Data Ingestion & Validation Service** to push real-time scores and event updates to the chat rooms.

- **Performance:** Optimize WebSocket server performance for many concurrent connections and high message throughput. Frontend should efficiently render incoming messages without performance degradation. Refer to "Performance Requirements" in NFRs (PRD).

- **Security:** Implement rigorous security measures to prevent chat spam, abuse, and unauthorized access. Ensure all messages are sanitized. Adhere to "Security Best Practices" in the Architecture Document.
