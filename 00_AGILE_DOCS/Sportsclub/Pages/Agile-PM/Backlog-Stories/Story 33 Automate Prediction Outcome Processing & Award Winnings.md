# Story 3.3: Automate Prediction Outcome Processing & Award Winnings

# Story 3.3: Automate Prediction Outcome Processing & Award Winnings

## Status: Draft

## Story

- As a **Sportsclub user**,

- I want my **prediction outcomes to be automatically processed and winnings awarded promptly**,

- so that I can **quickly see the results of my predictions and my coin balance updated accurately.**

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. The system automatically determines and records the official outcomes of completed sporting events.

2. For accurate predictions, winnings are calculated as (coins placed * odds at the time of prediction).

3. Calculated winnings are credited to the user's virtual wallet as soon as possible after the official event outcome is verified.

4. Users are notified of their prediction results (win/loss) and any coins awarded via an in-app status update.

5. Users can opt-in to receive notifications of their prediction results via email and/or text message.

6. The user's wallet balance accurately reflects the outcome (winnings added or placed coins deducted).

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Implement backend service/job to detect completed sporting events.

- [ ] Integrate with Data Ingestion & Validation Service to source official event outcomes and scores.

- [ ] Implement logic to verify event outcomes (e.g., cross-check multiple sources if available).

- [ ] Implement logic to calculate winnings for correct predictions.

- [ ] Implement backend logic to update prediction status (won/lost) in the database.

- [ ] Implement backend logic to deduct placed coins for lost predictions.

- [ ] Implement backend logic to credit winnings to user wallets for won predictions.

- [ ] Integrate with Notification Service for in-app status updates on prediction results.

- [ ] Integrate with Notification Service for opt-in email/text notifications on prediction results.

- [ ] Ensure the outcome processing service is robust and handles concurrent events.

## Dev Technical Guidance

This story is critical for the integrity of the core game loop and directly impacts user satisfaction. Focus on data accuracy, timely processing, and secure coin transfers.

- **Dependency:** This story **depends on Story 3.2: Enable Prediction Placement (Basic)** for existing predictions. It also relies on **Story 3.1: Display Major Sporting Events with Odds** for event data and **Story 2.3: Create Virtual Wallet and Display Balance** for wallet interactions. It also depends on **Epic 1** for foundational setup.

- **Data Sourcing:** Integrate with the **Data Ingestion & Validation Service** (from Component View) to obtain official event outcomes. Refer to its capabilities for validation and fallback mechanisms (CRAG).

- **Data Models:** Refer to the `Prediction`, `SportingEvent`, `Odds`, `VirtualWallet`, `CoinTransaction`, and `User` data models in the Architecture Document for schema definitions and relationships.

- **Scheduling/Triggers:** This process will likely involve a scheduled job or event-driven trigger (e.g., from Data Ingestion Service upon outcome availability).

- **Transaction Management:** Ensure winnings crediting and coin deductions are handled atomically and securely, guaranteeing data consistency. Refer to "Error Handling Strategy" for transaction principles.

- **Notifications:** Integrate with the Notification Service (from Component View) for all user alerts.

- **Real-time/Near Real-time:** The system should credit winnings "as soon as possible" and trigger in-app updates rapidly. This implies efficient processing pipelines.

- **Security:** Implement robust security measures to prevent unauthorized alteration of outcomes or coin manipulation. Adhere to "Security Best Practices" for data integrity.

- **Testing Guidance:**

    - **Approach:** Unit tests for outcome verification logic and winning calculations. Integration tests for data ingestion, database updates, and notification triggers. Performance testing for timely processing of multiple event outcomes concurrently.

    - **Special Considerations:** Thoroughly test various scenarios: correct prediction, incorrect prediction, cancelled event, tie-breaking scenarios (if applicable). Verify accurate coin updates and user notifications. Security testing for preventing outcome tampering or fraudulent coin awards.
