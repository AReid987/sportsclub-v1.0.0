# Story 2.1: Implement Subscription Purchase and Management

# Story 2.1: Implement Subscription Purchase and Management

## Status: Draft

## Story

- As a **Sportsclub user**,

- I want to **purchase and manage my monthly subscription**,

- so that I can **gain full access to the platform's features and ensure continuous service.**

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. The system allows users to select a monthly subscription plan.

2. The system supports specified payment methods for subscription purchase (e.g., Credit Card, PayPal, via Stripe/Lemon Squeezy integration).

3. Subscriptions are automatically recurring on a monthly basis.

4. Users can view their next billing date within a subscription management area.

5. Users can update their payment method within the subscription management area.

6. Users can cancel their subscription within the subscription management area.

7. If a recurring subscription payment fails, the user's account status is downgraded, disabling access to predictions and coin-based game interactions.

8. Upon successful subscription or payment, the user's status is updated to "active subscriber."

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Design and implement subscription selection UI.

- [ ] Integrate with selected payment gateway(s) (e.g., Stripe, Lemon Squeezy API).

- [ ] Implement backend logic for subscription purchase and payment processing.

- [ ] Implement logic for automatic monthly recurring billing.

- [ ] Design and implement subscription management UI (view billing date, update payment, cancel).

- [ ] Implement backend logic for updating payment methods.

- [ ] Implement backend logic for subscription cancellation.

- [ ] Implement backend logic for handling failed recurring payments and account downgrades.

- [ ] Update user's subscription status in the database upon successful purchase/payment.

- [ ] Ensure secure handling of payment information (PCI compliance via gateway).

## Dev Technical Guidance

This story is critical for the platform's revenue model. Focus on secure and reliable integration with payment gateways and robust handling of subscription lifecycle events.

- **Dependency:** This story **depends on Epic 1** being completed (User Foundation & Onboarding, including basic cloud infrastructure and initial database setup). Specifically, it depends on **Story 1.4: Set up Initial Database Instance and Schema** for user and subscription data persistence, and **Story 1.3: Provision Foundational Cloud Infrastructure** for network and security.

- **Payment Gateways:** Refer to "Subscription & Wallet Management" Functional Requirements in the PRD for the list of desired payment gateways (Stripe, Lemon Squeezy, PayPal, CashApp, Apple Pay, credit card, Venmo). Prioritize integration with a core one (e.g., Stripe) for MVP.

- **API Integration:** Refer to the chosen payment gateway's official API documentation for secure integration practices.

- **Data Models:** Refer to the `Subscription` and `User` data models in the Architecture Document for schema definitions.

- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling for payment processing failures, as outlined in the "Error Handling Strategy" section of the Architecture Document.

- **Security:** Adhere strictly to "Security Best Practices" in the Architecture Document, especially concerning sensitive financial data and PCI compliance (leveraging the gateway for this).

- **Notifications:** Consider how to integrate with the Notification Service (from Component View) for status updates (e.g., subscription activated, payment failed).

- **Testing Guidance:**

    - **Approach:** Unit tests and integration tests will be developed for backend logic and payment gateway integration. Manual UI testing will be performed for user flows.

    - **Special Considerations:** Security testing, particularly focusing on payment processing, sensitive data handling, and PCI compliance aspects, is crucial for this story.
