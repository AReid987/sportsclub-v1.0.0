# Story 1.4: Set up Initial Database Instance and Schema

# Status: Draft

## Story

- As a **developer**,

- I want to **set up the initial database instance and schema for Sportsclub**,

- so that **user accounts and basic platform data can be securely stored and managed.**

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. A managed PostgreSQL database instance is provisioned in the chosen cloud provider (AWS RDS or GCP Cloud SQL).

2. Database connectivity is successfully established from a secure environment (e.g., via a jump box or development machine within the VPC).

3. The initial database schema for core entities (e.g., `User`, `Subscription`, `VirtualWallet`, `CoinTransaction`) is defined.

4. Database migrations are configured (e.g., using Drizzle ORM's migration capabilities or a standalone migration tool) to manage schema changes.

5. The initial schema is successfully applied to the database instance.

6. Basic read/write operations to the `User` table are verified.

7. Database security (e.g., strong password, network access restrictions via security groups/firewall rules) is configured according to best practices.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Provision managed PostgreSQL instance (AWS RDS or GCP Cloud SQL).

- [ ] Configure database connectivity.

- [ ] Define initial database schema for `User`, `Subscription`, `VirtualWallet`, `CoinTransaction` entities.

- [ ] Set up database migration tool (e.g., Drizzle ORM migrations).

- [ ] Apply initial schema migrations to the database.

- [ ] Verify basic read/write operations for user data.

- [ ] Configure database security settings.

## Dev Technical Guidance

This story focuses on establishing the core data persistence layer. Pay close attention to security and ensure future iterative schema changes are manageable.

- **Dependency:** This story **depends on Story 1.3: Provision Foundational Cloud Infrastructure** as the database will reside within the established cloud network.

- **Database Technology:** PostgreSQL (version 16.x) is the chosen relational database.

- **Cloud Provider:** Use the same cloud provider chosen in Story 1.3 (AWS or GCP).

- **ORM/Migration Tool:** Drizzle ORM is preferred for ORM and its migration capabilities. If Drizzle's migration tool is not feasible for the chosen backend language, a standalone migration tool (e.g., Alembic for Python) should be used.

- **Schema Definition:** Refer to the "Data Models" section in the Architecture Document for conceptual entity definitions (`User`, `Subscription`, `VirtualWallet`, `CoinTransaction`).

- **Security:** Adhere to "Security Best Practices" in the Architecture Document for database access patterns, least privilege, and encryption. Ensure the database is not publicly accessible.

- **Verification:** Confirm database is accessible from authorized environments and basic data operations work as expected.
