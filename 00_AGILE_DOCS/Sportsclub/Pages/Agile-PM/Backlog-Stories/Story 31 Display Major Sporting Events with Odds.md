# Story 3.1: Display Major Sporting Events with Odds

# Story 3.1: Display Major Sporting Events with Odds

## Status: Draft

## Story

- As a **Sportsclub user**,

- I want to **view a list of available major sporting events with their odds**,

- so that I can **easily find events I'm interested in and understand my prediction options.**

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. The system displays a list of available major sporting events.

2. Events are categorized and displayed by sport by default.

3. Users are provided with filter options (e.g., by date, popularity) to change the display and sorting of events.

4. Users can search for specific events or filter by sport type.

5. For each event, the system displays: teams/participants, event date and start time (with clear timezone indication), sport type, and odds for each potential outcome/winner.

6. The list of events and their associated odds are updated frequently, at a minimum of once per hour.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Implement backend API endpoint for fetching major sporting events and their odds.

- [ ] Implement frontend UI for displaying the list of events.

- [ ] Implement frontend logic for categorization and default display by sport.

- [ ] Implement frontend filter and search functionalities.

- [ ] Ensure all required event and odds information is displayed correctly in the UI.

- [ ] Implement backend logic for frequently updating event and odds data.

- [ ] Integrate with the Data Ingestion & Validation Service to source event and odds data.

## Dev Technical Guidance

This story is the entry point for the core game. Focus on a clear, performant display of dynamic data and robust data sourcing integration.

- **Dependency:** This story **depends on Epic 1** (foundational setup) and **Epic 2** (user is subscribed/has wallet). Specifically, it depends on **Story 1.3: Provision Foundational Cloud Infrastructure** and **Story 1.4: Set up Initial Database Instance and Schema** for data storage, and implicitly relies on the **Data Ingestion & Validation Service** being available conceptually.

- **Data Sourcing:** This story integrates with the **Data Ingestion & Validation Service** (from Component View) to obtain event and odds data. Refer to the "API Reference" in the Architecture Document for external API details (The Odds API) and scraping sources.

- **Data Models:** Refer to the `SportingEvent` and `Odds` data models in the Architecture Document for schema definitions.

- **Real-time/Near Real-time:** While the AC states "at least once per hour," the overall NFR for odds is "the faster the better." Design the update mechanism to allow for potential future near real-time updates.

- **Performance:** Optimize frontend rendering for large lists of events. Backend API endpoints should be performant in serving event data. Refer to "Performance Requirements" in NFRs.

- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling for data ingestion failures, missing odds, or external API issues, gracefully degrading or informing the user as per the "Error Handling Strategy" and data validation approach.

- **Security:** Ensure secure data transfer and display, preventing injection vulnerabilities.
