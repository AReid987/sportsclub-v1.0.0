# Story X.X: Conduct Initial Sprint Planning & Story Pointing Session

# Story X.X: Conduct Initial Sprint Planning & Story Pointing Session

## Status: Draft

## Story

- As a **Scrum Master**,

- I want to **conduct an initial sprint planning and story pointing session with the development team**,

- so that we can **establish realistic sprint goals and a shared understanding of effort for upcoming stories.**

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. The validated backlog of stories (from all Epics 1-8) is prepared and made accessible for the planning session.

2. A collaborative meeting with the development team is facilitated to review top-priority stories.

3. The team is guided in collaboratively estimating story points for a selected set of top stories using an agreed-upon technique (e.g., Planning Poker, T-shirt sizing).

4. A realistic sprint goal for the first sprint is collectively defined and agreed upon by the team.

5. Estimated story points are documented for all stories discussed and selected for the first sprint.

6. The agreed-upon sprint goal and the list of selected stories for the first sprint are documented in the project backlog or relevant planning tool.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Review and organize the validated stories from all Epics, ensuring they are ready for discussion.

- [ ] Schedule and prepare for the initial sprint planning meeting with the development team.

- [ ] Introduce the concept of story pointing and the chosen estimation technique (e.g., Planning Poker rules).

- [ ] Facilitate the team's discussion of each story, clarifying questions as needed.

- [ ] Guide the team through the story pointing process.

- [ ] Record the agreed-upon story points for each estimated story.

- [ ] Facilitate the discussion to define the sprint goal.

- [ ] Document the sprint goal and the stories committed to the first sprint.

- [ ] Communicate the outcome of the planning session to relevant stakeholders.

## Dev Technical Guidance

This story focuses on a crucial Scrum event that enables predictable delivery and team alignment. The Scrum Master should ensure active participation from the development team and clear documentation of the session's outcomes.

- **Backlog Readiness:** The Scrum Master should confirm that all stories are clear, well-defined, and meet the "Definition of Ready" as established by the `story-draft-checklist` validation.

- **Collaboration Focus:** Emphasize collaboration and shared understanding over strict adherence to numbers. The goal is a common agreement on complexity, effort, and risk.

- **Output Documentation:** The output of this story is a documented sprint plan, including story points and a sprint goal, which will feed directly into the execution phase.

- **Referenced Documents:** This process will heavily rely on the overall PRD, Architecture Document, and individual story files. The Scrum Master should be prepared to reference relevant sections to answer team questions.
