# Story 1.1: Establish Project Repositories and Monorepo Structure

# Story 1.1: Establish Project Repositories and Monorepo Structure

### Status: Draft

## Story

- As a **developer**,

- I want to **establish the foundational Git repositories and monorepo structure for Sportsclub**,

- so that the **project codebase is organized and ready for collaborative development of frontend and backend services**.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. The project root directory is initialized as a Git repository.

2. A `.gitignore` file is configured at the project root to exclude common development artifacts (e.g., `node_modules`, build directories, environment files).

3. Turborepo is initialized and configured at the monorepo root.

4. A `packages/` directory is created at the monorepo root for housing individual workspaces.

5. An empty workspace directory is created for the `web` (Next.js frontend) application within `packages/`.

6. An empty workspace directory is created for `auth-service` (FastAPI backend initial microservice) within `packages/`.

7. The root `package.json` is configured to define the `packages/` directories as Turborepo workspaces.

8. All initial structural changes are committed to the Git repository.

9. The local Git repository is successfully pushed to a remote repository (e.g., GitHub).

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Initialize Git repository at the project root.

- [ ] Create and configure initial `.gitignore` file.

- [ ] Initialize Turborepo within the monorepo root directory.

- [ ] Create `packages/` directory.

- [ ] Create `packages/web` directory.

- [ ] Create `packages/auth-service` directory.

- [ ] Update root `package.json` to configure Turborepo workspaces.

- [ ] Perform initial commit(s) of the new project structure.

- [ ] Set up remote Git repository and push initial changes.

## Dev Technical Guidance

This story focuses on establishing the core monorepo foundation. The development agent should prioritize setting up Turborepo correctly to enable efficient build caching and task orchestration across the planned Next.js frontend and FastAPI microservices.

- **Repository Structure:** The project will follow a monorepo structure. All application code (frontend, backend microservices, shared libraries) will reside under the `packages/` directory.

- **Version Control:** Git is the chosen Version Control System.

- **Monorepo Tool:** Turborepo will be used for monorepo management. Refer to Turborepo's official documentation for initialization and workspace configuration.

- **Frontend Workspace:** The Next.js frontend will reside in `packages/web`.

- **Backend Workspace:** The initial backend microservice (Auth & User Service) will reside in `packages/auth-service`.

- **Gitignore:** Ensure standard exclusions for Node.js (`node_modules`, `.next`, build outputs) and Python (`__pycache__`, `venv`, `.mypy_cache`) are included.

- **Initial** `package.json`**:** Configure the `workspaces` array in the root `package.json` to include `"packages/*"`.
