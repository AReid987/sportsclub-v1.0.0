# Story 4.3: Implement Monthly Wallet Reset

# Story 4.3: Implement Monthly Wallet Reset

## Status: Draft

## Story

- As a **Sportsclub user**,

- I want my **virtual coin balance to be reset monthly after prizes are determined**,

- so that I can **start each new competition cycle on an equal footing.**

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. On the first day of each calendar month, after prizes for the previous month are determined and winners notified, the virtual coin balances in all player wallets are reset to zero.

2. Information regarding the monthly wallet reset is communicated to users through in-app notifications prior to and upon reset.

3. Users' historical statistics (e.g., past performance, prediction history, previous leaderboard rankings, achievements) are persisted and remain viewable by the user despite the coin reset.

4. The wallet reset process is robust and handles all active user wallets efficiently.

5. The reset process is auditable, allowing verification of correct coin reset.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Implement backend service/job to trigger wallet reset process on the 1st of each month.

- [ ] Implement logic to identify all active player wallets from the previous month.

- [ ] Implement logic to set all identified wallet balances to zero.

- [ ] Implement logic to ensure historical statistics are archived/persisted before reset.

- [ ] Integrate with Notification Service for in-app notifications prior to reset.

- [ ] Integrate with Notification Service for in-app notifications upon reset.

- [ ] Ensure the wallet reset service is idempotent and handles large numbers of wallets.

- [ ] Implement robust error handling and logging for the reset process.

## Dev Technical Guidance

This story is vital for the fairness and continuity of the monthly competition. Focus on data integrity, atomicity of the reset, and efficient processing.

- **Dependency:** This story **depends on Story 4.2: Implement Monthly Cash Prize Determination** (to ensure prizes are determined *before* reset). It also relies on **Epic 1** for foundational setup and **Epic 2** (user/wallet data, specifically Story 2.3 for wallet creation).

- **Scheduling:** The reset process will likely be triggered by a scheduled job (e.g., a cron job in a cloud service) running after the prize determination job.

- **Data Models:** Refer to the `VirtualWallet`, `User`, `CoinTransaction`, and relevant historical data models in the Architecture Document for schema definitions.

- **Transaction Management:** Ensure the wallet reset operation is handled atomically and securely to guarantee data consistency. Refer to "Error Handling Strategy" for principles.

- **Notifications:** Integrate with the Notification Service (from Component View) for all user alerts.

- **Security:** Implement rigorous security measures to prevent unauthorized wallet resets or data corruption. Ensure historical data is securely persisted. Adhere to "Security Best Practices."

- **Testing Guidance:**

    - **Approach:** Unit tests for reset logic and historical data persistence. Integration tests for scheduled job triggers and database updates. Performance testing for efficient processing of all active wallets.

    - **Special Considerations:** Comprehensive testing of reset scenarios, including edge cases (e.g., brand new users, users with zero activity, users with very high balances). Verify accurate historical data persistence. Rigorous security testing for preventing unauthorized resets or data loss. Auditability of the reset.
