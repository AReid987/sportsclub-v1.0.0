# Story 7.1: Implement a Reddit-like Forum (Basic Functionality)

# Story 7.1: Implement a Reddit-like Forum (Basic Functionality)

## Status: Draft

## Story

- As a **Sportsclub user**,

- I want to **create posts and comments, and vote on forum content**,

- so that I can **engage in discussions and contribute to the community.**

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. Users can create new posts/topics within the forum.

2. Users can comment on existing posts.

3. Users can vote (e.g., upvote/downvote) on posts and comments.

4. The forum has predefined categories/sub-forums for organization (e.g., by sport, strategy).

5. Posts and comments support text, embedded links, and uploaded images.

6. User profiles are linked to their forum activity (e.g., displaying their posts and comments).

7. The AI assistant can support forum engagement by:

    - Posting discussion prompts and relevant topics.

    - Responding to user posts and comments with helpful information or to facilitate discussion (adhering to AI Q&A guidelines).

    - Automatically flagging potentially problematic content (e.g., spam, abuse) for review on an internal moderation dashboard.

    - *(New Concept)* Potentially enabling embedded AI chat instances within specific forum categories, sub-categories, or posts for focused, contextual discussions with an AI.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Implement backend API endpoints for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting forum posts and comments.

- [ ] Implement backend API endpoints for handling upvotes/downvotes on posts and comments.

- [ ] Implement backend logic for managing forum categories/sub-forums.

- [ ] Implement frontend UI for displaying forum categories and posts in a browsable format.

- [ ] Implement frontend UI for creating new posts (text input, link embedding, image upload).

- [ ] Implement frontend UI for displaying individual posts and their comments.

- [ ] Implement frontend UI for commenting on posts.

- [ ] Implement frontend UI for upvoting/downvoting mechanism.

- [ ] Implement backend integration with the **Community Service** for core forum functionalities.

- [ ] Implement backend integration with the **AI Assistant Service** for AI participation in forum engagement.

- [ ] Implement backend logic for AI to post discussion prompts and respond to user content.

- [ ] Implement backend logic for AI to flag problematic content for moderation.

- [ ] Link user profiles to their forum activity on the frontend.

- [ ] Ensure secure handling of user-generated content and image uploads.

## Dev Technical Guidance

This story lays the foundation for community interaction. Focus on robust CRUD operations for content, secure handling of user submissions, and initial AI integration for engagement and moderation.

- **Dependency:** This story **depends on Epic 1** for foundational setup (user accounts, basic infrastructure). It also relies on the **Community Service** for core forum functionalities and the **AI Assistant Service** for AI participation (both from Component View in Architecture Document).

- **Data Models:** Refer to the `ForumPost`, `ForumComment`, and `User` data models in the Architecture Document for schema definitions. Consider a new `ForumCategory` data model if not already specified.

- **API Design:** Design clear and RESTful API endpoints for forum operations, adhering to the "API Design and Standards" in the Architecture Document.

- **AI Integration:** The AI Assistant's role here involves content generation (discussion prompts, responses) and content moderation (flagging). Ensure the AI's responses adhere to "AI Assistant Q&A Guidelines" (PRD 5.a.iii) and do not provide betting advice. The "AI Assistant Service" is the key integration point.

- **User-Generated Content (UGC) Security:** Implement robust input sanitization for all text content to prevent XSS. Securely handle image uploads (e.g., validate file types/sizes, store in S3, scan for malicious content if applicable). Adhere to "Security Best Practices" in the Architecture Document.

- **Real-time Considerations:** While real-time chat is a separate story, consider how new posts/comments might be reflected in near real-time (e.g., polling, or a push mechanism if already in place for other features).

- **Moderation:** The AI's flagging mechanism should integrate with an internal moderation dashboard (TBD in later stories) where human moderators can review.

- **UI/UX:** Design an intuitive and user-friendly interface for forum navigation, posting, and commenting. Ensure clear visual feedback for voting actions. Refer to the UI/UX Specification for overall design principles.
