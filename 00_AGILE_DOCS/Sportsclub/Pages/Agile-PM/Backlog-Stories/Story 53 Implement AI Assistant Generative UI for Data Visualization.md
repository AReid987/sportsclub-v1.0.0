# Story 5.3: Implement AI Assistant Generative UI for Data Visualization

# Story 5.3: Implement AI Assistant Generative UI for Data Visualization

## Status: Draft

## Story

- As a **Sportsclub user**,

- I want the **AI assistant to generate and display visualizations of sports-related data**,

- so that I can **gain deeper insights into statistics and patterns to improve my predictions.**

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. Users can request data visualizations from the AI assistant (e.g., "Show Team A's win rate over time," "Visualize my prediction accuracy by odds").

2. The AI assistant is capable of generating and displaying standard visualization types (e.g., charts, graphs) suitable for the requested data.

3. When a user requests a data visualization, a clear loading indicator is displayed while the visualization is being generated.

4. The generated visual content is displayed clearly and correctly within the user interface.

5. The AI assistant can generate visualizations for a broad array of sports data (e.g., team trends, player performance, historical data, user's own prediction patterns).

6. The AI assistant generates factual visualizations based on available data, and does not create misleading or inaccurate visuals.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Implement frontend UI to allow users to request data visualizations (e.g., specific query format, button in chat).

- [ ] Implement frontend logic to display a loading indicator during visualization generation.

- [ ] Implement backend API endpoint in AI Assistant Service to handle data visualization requests.

- [ ] Implement backend logic within AI Assistant Service to:

    - Interpret user's visualization request.

    - Retrieve relevant data from appropriate data stores (e.g., historical sports data, user prediction history).

    - Process data and generate instructions/configurations for visualization (e.g., JSON config for a charting library).

    - Utilize LLM and Knowledge Graph where necessary for interpretation or data retrieval.

- [ ] Implement frontend logic to render the generated visualization instructions/configurations into a displayable chart/graph.

- [ ] Ensure visualization data and presentation are factual and accurate.

- [ ] Implement logging for visualization requests and generation for monitoring and improvement.

## Dev Technical Guidance

This story is highly complex, combining AI interpretation with data retrieval and dynamic UI generation. Focus on accurate data retrieval, robust visualization generation, and a smooth user experience.

- **Dependency:** This story **depends on Story 5.1: Set up Core AI Assistant Backend Infrastructure** (for LLM integration, caching, knowledge graph) and **Story 5.2: Implement AI Assistant Q&A Functionality** (for basic AI interaction patterns). It also relies on **Epic 1** for foundational setup, and implicitly on **Epic 3** and **Epic 4** for access to historical prediction and leaderboard data.

- **AI Assistant Service:** This story primarily involves extending the `ai-assistant-service` microservice.

- **Data Retrieval:** Access to various data stores (e.g., PostgreSQL for historical sports data, user prediction history).

- **Visualization Generation:** The AI will generate data/instructions *for* a charting library, rather than generating a raw image. The frontend will then render this. This involves a clear contract for the generated visualization data (e.g., a standardized JSON format that a charting library can consume).

    - **Charting Libraries:** Frontend will likely use charting libraries (e.g., AntV G6 - as noted in UI/UX Spec).

- **LLM & Knowledge Graph (KG):** Leverage the LLM and KG from Story 5.1 for interpreting complex requests and retrieving nuanced data.

- **Performance:** Optimize the entire pipeline from request to visualization display, especially for data retrieval and AI processing. Displaying a loading indicator is crucial.

- **Security:** Implement rigorous input sanitization to prevent prompt injection. Ensure sensitive data is not inadvertently exposed in visualizations or underlying data retrieval.

- **Testing Guidance:**

    - **Approach:** Unit tests for data retrieval logic, data processing for visualization, and interpretation of user requests. Integration tests for the end-to-end flow (user request -> AI service -> data stores/LLM/KG -> visualization config -> frontend rendering). Manual testing for visual accuracy, clarity, and adherence to factual data representation.

    - **Special Considerations:** Testing for various types of visualization requests (e.g., simple charts, complex multi-data visuals). Verify accurate data representation in charts. Rigorous prompt injection testing. Performance testing for generation time and loading indicators.

- **External Documentation References:** For this and future stories, explicitly provide specific links to relevant sections of external documentation (e.g., charting library docs, LLM API docs for advanced features, knowledge graph tooling guides) where possible, rather than just general documentation.
