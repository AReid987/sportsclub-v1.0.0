# Story 8.4: Implement Community Challenges/Activities for Bonus Coins

# Story 8.4: Implement Community Challenges/Activities for Bonus Coins

## Status: Draft

## Story

- As a **Sportsclub user**,

- I want to **participate in various community challenges and activities**,

- so that I can **earn bonus virtual coins and engage more with the community.**

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. The system offers various community challenges and activities where users can earn bonus virtual coins.

2. Initial types of challenges/activities include: Trivia games (e.g., scheduled, agent-led), Special prediction challenges (e.g., predicting outcomes for a specific set of events), and Participation goals (e.g., rewards for a certain number of forum posts or comments within a period).

3. Challenges and activities are announced to users via in-app banner announcements.

4. Challenges and activities are announced to users via messages in the user's in-app inbox.

5. Users can opt-in to receive challenge/activity announcements via text message or email.

6. The system automatically awards bonus coins to users upon their successful completion or qualification in these challenges/activities.

7. The bonus coin awards are securely added to the user's virtual wallet.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Implement backend service/logic within the Gamification Service to define, manage, and track various community challenges/activities.

- [ ] Implement logic for specific challenge types:

    - [ ] Trivia games (e.g., question/answer validation, scoring).

    - [ ] Special prediction challenges (e.g., linking to specific events, outcome tracking).

    - [ ] Participation goals (e.g., tracking forum posts/comments).

- [ ] Implement backend integration with the **AI Assistant Service** for agent-led challenges (e.g., AI asking trivia questions, managing game flow).

- [ ] Implement backend integration with the **Community Service** to track participation metrics (e.g., forum activity).

- [ ] Implement backend logic for automatically awarding bonus coins upon challenge completion/qualification.

- [ ] Integrate with the Notification Service for in-app banner announcements, in-app inbox messages, and opt-in email/text notifications.

- [ ] Implement frontend UI for displaying available challenges/activities (e.g., a "Challenges" section).

- [ ] Implement frontend UI for participating in specific challenge types (e.g., trivia game interface).

- [ ] Implement robust error handling and logging for challenge management and bonus distribution.

- [ ] Ensure secure handling of bonus awards and challenge participation data.

## Dev Technical Guidance

This story broadens the gamification scope to community-driven activities, involving complex interactions between services. Focus on flexible challenge configuration, accurate tracking, and secure, automated bonus awards.

- **Dependency:** This story **depends on Epic 1** for foundational setup (user accounts, basic infrastructure). It also relies on **Epic 2** for wallet management, **Epic 5** for the AI Assistant Service, and **Epic 7** for Community Platform features (Forum and Live Chat) to support various challenge types. It also relies on the **Gamification Service**, **Community Service**, **AI Assistant Service**, and **Notification Service** (all from Component View in Architecture Document) for core logic and user alerts.

- **Business Rules:** The specific mechanics, criteria, and bonus amounts for various challenge types will need to be defined by the Product Manager. This is a **CRITICAL EXTERNAL DEPENDENCY** for this story's full implementation. The current story defines the *framework* to support these challenges.

- **Data Models:** Refer to the `User`, `VirtualWallet`, `CoinTransaction`, and `GamificationActivity` data models in the Architecture Document for schema definitions. A new `Challenge` or `Activity` data model might be necessary to define challenge parameters, rules, and user participation.

- **Scheduling/Triggers:** Challenges might be scheduled or triggered manually. Tracking participation goals will be event-driven (e.g., new forum post event).

- **AI Integration:** The AI Assistant's role here is crucial for leading interactive challenges like trivia. Ensure AI's interactions are consistent with its persona and guidelines (PRD 5.a.iii).

- **Transaction Management:** Ensure coin awards are handled atomically and securely, guaranteeing data consistency. Refer to "Error Handling Strategy" for principles.

- **Notifications:** Integrate with the Notification Service (from Component View) for all user alerts.

- **Security:** Implement rigorous security measures to prevent manipulation of challenge outcomes or fraudulent bonus awards. Adhere to "Security Best Practices."

- **Testing Guidance:**

    - **Approach:** Unit tests for challenge logic, tracking mechanisms, eligibility checks, and bonus calculation. Integration tests for interaction between Gamification, AI Assistant, Community, and Notification services. Manual testing for user experience of participating in different challenge types and receiving awards.

    - **Special Considerations:** Thoroughly test various challenge scenarios and their criteria. Rigorous security testing to prevent cheating or fraudulent awards. Test AI-led challenges for correct flow and consistent AI behavior.
