# Story 1.5: Document Local Development Environment Setup

# Story 1.5: Document Local Development Environment Setup

## Status: Draft

## Story

- As a **developer**,

- I want to **document and provide necessary scripts/configurations for a consistent local development environment setup**,

- so that **developers can easily set up their machines and quickly start contributing to the Sportsclub project.**

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. A `docs/dev-environment-setup.md` file is created, detailing step-by-step instructions for setting up the local development environment.

2. The documentation specifies all required tools and their versions (e.g., Node.js LTS, Python 3.11+, Docker Desktop, Git).

3. Instructions for installing monorepo dependencies (PNPM for JS/TS, PDM/uv for Python) are clearly provided.

4. Guidance on configuring environment variables for local development (e.g., using `.env` files not committed to Git) is included.

5. Instructions for running local development servers for both the frontend (Next.js) and an initial backend service (FastAPI) are provided.

6. Any necessary scripts or configuration files (e.g., `.vscode` settings for consistent linting/formatting) are included in the repository.

7. A new developer can successfully follow the documented steps to set up their local environment and run the basic frontend and backend services.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Create `docs/dev-environment-setup.md` file.

- [ ] Document required tools and their versions.

- [ ] Document dependency installation steps for PNPM and PDM/uv.

- [ ] Add guidance on local environment variable management.

- [ ] Provide instructions for running local Next.js development server.

- [ ] Provide instructions for running local FastAPI development server.

- [ ] Add any relevant `scripts/` or `.vscode/` configurations.

- [ ] Verify documentation clarity by attempting to follow the steps.

## Dev Technical Guidance

This story focuses on developer experience and onboarding efficiency. Clear and accurate documentation is paramount.

- **Dependency:** This story **depends on Story 1.1: Establish Project Repositories and Monorepo Structure** as the monorepo structure is the basis for the dev environment.

- **Documentation Location:** The main setup guide will reside in `docs/dev-environment-setup.md`.

- **Tools & Versions:** Refer to the "Definitive Tech Stack Selections" in the Architecture Document for precise tool versions.

- **Monorepo:** Ensure the documentation leverages `Turborepo` commands for running multiple services and managing dependencies across packages.

- **Environment Variables:** Reference the approach for handling `.env` files as per "Security Best Practices" in the Architecture Document.

- **Verification:** The success of this story is measured by how easily a new developer can get started by following the instructions.
