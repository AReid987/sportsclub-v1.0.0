# Story 1.3: Provision Foundational Cloud Infrastructure

## Status: Draft

## Story

- As a **developer**,

- I want to **provision the essential foundational cloud infrastructure for Sportsclub**,

- so that **the project has a secure and scalable base environment in the chosen cloud provider for deploying initial services**.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. A dedicated cloud account (e.g., AWS account or GCP project) is set up for Sportsclub development, with appropriate billing configured.

2. Initial network configuration (e.g., Virtual Private Cloud/VPC on AWS, VPC Network on GCP) is established, including private subnets for application resources.

3. Basic Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles and policies are defined for developer access and initial service roles, adhering to the principle of least privilege.

4. A foundational security group (AWS) or firewall rules (GCP) are configured to allow necessary internal communication and restrict external access.

5. Placeholder resources (e.g., an empty S3 bucket for static assets, a placeholder Lambda function/Cloud Run service, or a basic managed database instance) are provisioned to validate initial connectivity and service setup.

6. The infrastructure is deployed using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) (tool TBD in later story).

7. Initial cloud resource provisioning is successfully verified in the cloud console.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Set up Sportsclub cloud account and configure billing.

- [ ] Create initial VPC/Network with public and private subnets.

- [ ] Define basic IAM roles for developers and initial application services.

- [ ] Configure foundational security groups/firewall rules.

- [ ] Provision placeholder cloud resources (e.g., S3 bucket, basic compute instance/serverless function).

- [ ] Implement IaC for the provisioned infrastructure.

- [ ] Verify cloud resource provisioning in the cloud console.

## Dev Technical Guidance

This story focuses on laying the fundamental cloud groundwork. The development agent should prioritize security and scalability in this initial setup.

- **Dependency:** This story **depends on Story 1.1: Establish Project Repositories and Monorepo Structure** as infrastructure code will reside in the monorepo.

- **Cloud Provider:** The primary cloud provider chosen is **AWS or GCP**. The developer should pick one to proceed for this story.

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** While the specific IaC tool (e.g., AWS CDK, Terraform) is TBD in the Architecture Document, for this story, focus on a basic IaC setup to provision the outlined resources. A simple CloudFormation template or Terraform configuration could be used.

- **Network Design:** Refer to the "Network Security Design" in the Architecture Document's "Security Best Practices" for principles (private subnets, VPCs, network access controls).

- **IAM:** Adhere to the "Principle of Least Privilege" from "Security Best Practices" when defining roles.

- **Verification:** Confirm that resources appear correctly in the cloud console and basic connectivity tests can be performed.
