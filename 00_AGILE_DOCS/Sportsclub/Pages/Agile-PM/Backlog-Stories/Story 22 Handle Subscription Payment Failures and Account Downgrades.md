# Story 2.2: Handle Subscription Payment Failures and Account Downgrades

# Story 2.2: Handle Subscription Payment Failures and Account Downgrades

## Status: Draft

## Story

- As a **Sportsclub user**,

- I want my **account status to be appropriately managed if a subscription payment fails**,

- so that **my access to features is clear and the platform's service continuity is maintained.**

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. The system detects a failed recurring subscription payment.

2. Upon detection of a failed payment, the user's account status is automatically downgraded.

3. Downgraded accounts are prevented from accessing prediction placement and coin-based game interactions.

4. Users with a downgraded account status are clearly notified of the payment failure and their restricted access via in-app messages and email.

5. The system provides a clear mechanism for users to rectify failed payments (e.g., update payment method).

6. Upon successful rectification of a failed payment, the user's account status is automatically restored to "active subscriber" with full feature access.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Implement logic for detecting failed recurring subscription payments from the payment gateway.

- [ ] Implement backend logic for automatically downgrading user account status upon payment failure.

- [ ] Implement frontend and backend logic to enforce feature restrictions (prediction, coin interactions) for downgraded accounts.

- [ ] Design and implement in-app notification system for payment failures and access restrictions.

- [ ] Integrate with Notification Service (email) for external user alerts on payment failures.

- [ ] Design and implement UI/UX for users to rectify failed payments (e.g., "Update Payment" flow).

- [ ] Implement backend logic for processing rectified payments and restoring account status.

## Dev Technical Guidance

This story is critical for managing user access and ensuring fair use of the platform when payments are disrupted. Focus on reliable detection of failures and clear communication.

- **Dependency:** This story **depends on Story 2.1: Implement Subscription Purchase and Management** for its subscription and payment gateway integration logic. It also relies on **Epic 1** for user accounts and basic infrastructure.

- **Payment Gateway Integration:** Leverage the existing payment gateway integration from Story 2.1 to receive webhooks or query for failed payment statuses.

- **Data Models:** Refer to the `User` and `Subscription` data models in the Architecture Document for updating `status` fields.

- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling for payment gateway callbacks and status updates, as outlined in the "Error Handling Strategy."

- **Notifications:** Integrate with the Notification Service (from Component View) for sending email notifications on payment failures.

- **Security:** Ensure secure handling of payment-related notifications and status updates.

- **Testing Guidance:**

    - **Approach:** Unit tests for backend logic, integration tests for payment gateway webhooks/callbacks. Manual UI testing for user flows (downgrade, rectification, restore).

    - **Special Considerations:** Thoroughly test various failure scenarios (e.g., invalid card, insufficient funds, network error during payment). Verify correct enforcement of feature restrictions and accurate status restoration.
