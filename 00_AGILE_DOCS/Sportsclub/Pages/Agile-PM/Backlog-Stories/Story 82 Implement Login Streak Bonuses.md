# Story 8.2: Implement Login Streak Bonuses

# Story 8.2: Implement Login Streak Bonuses

## Status: Draft

## Story

- As a **Sportsclub user**,

- I want to **be rewarded with bonus virtual coins and digital badges for maintaining a login streak**,

- so that I can **feel recognized for my consistent engagement and have more coins for predictions.**

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. The system tracks a user's login streak, defined by logging in or performing qualifying app activity on consecutive days.

2. Missing a day of login/activity automatically resets the user's login streak to zero.

3. The system awards users with bonus virtual coins and/or digital badges upon achieving predefined login streak milestones.

4. Users are notified of their login streak achievements and any awarded bonuses via in-app status icon/notification.

5. Users can view their current login streak count in their profile or a dedicated gamification section.

6. *(Details TBD: Specific streak milestones, corresponding coin amounts, and badge designs need to be defined. How rewards scale with longer streaks also needs to be detailed).*

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Implement backend service/logic to track a user's daily login/activity for streak calculation.

- [ ] Implement backend logic for determining if a login streak is maintained or broken.

- [ ] Implement backend logic for resetting a user's login streak to zero if a day is missed.

- [ ] Implement backend logic to identify predefined login streak milestones achieved.

- [ ] Implement backend logic for awarding bonus virtual coins for milestones.

- [ ] (Future consideration: Implement logic for awarding digital badges for milestones).

- [ ] Integrate with the Notification Service for in-app notifications about streak achievements and bonuses.

- [ ] Implement frontend UI to display the user's current login streak count.

- [ ] Implement frontend UI to display awarded digital badges (if applicable).

- [ ] Implement robust error handling and logging for the streak tracking and award process.

- [ ] Ensure the streak tracking mechanism is idempotent and handles edge cases (e.g., first-time login, multiple logins in a day).

## Dev Technical Guidance

This story enhances user engagement through rewarding consistent behavior. Focus on accurate streak tracking, flexible milestone configuration, and secure bonus awards.

- **Dependency:** This story **depends on Epic 1** for foundational setup (user accounts, basic infrastructure) and **Epic 2** for wallet management (specifically Story 2.3 for wallet creation). It relies on the **Gamification Service** (from Component View in Architecture Document) for core logic and the **Notification Service** for user alerts. It also uses the concept of "qualifying app activity" which might be linked to general user interaction logging.

- **Business Rules (TBD):** The specific streak milestones, corresponding coin amounts, and badge designs need to be obtained from the Product Manager. How rewards scale with longer streaks also needs to be detailed. This is a **CRITICAL EXTERNAL DEPENDENCY** for this story's full implementation. The current story defines the *mechanism* to track and apply these rules.

- **Data Models:** Refer to the `User`, `VirtualWallet`, `CoinTransaction`, and `GamificationActivity` data models in the Architecture Document for schema definitions. A new field on the User model (e.g., `lastLoginDate`, `loginStreakCount`) might be necessary to persist streak data.

- **Scheduling/Triggers:** Streak tracking and award logic will likely be triggered by user login/activity events, with daily checks to determine streak continuation.

- **Transaction Management:** Ensure coin awards are handled atomically and securely, guaranteeing data consistency. Refer to "Error Handling Strategy" for principles.

- **Notifications:** Integrate with the Notification Service (from Component View) for all user alerts.

- **Security:** Implement rigorous security measures to prevent manipulation of login streaks or fraudulent bonus awards. Adhere to "Security Best Practices."

- **Testing Guidance:**

    - **Approach:** Unit tests for streak tracking logic (increment, reset), milestone detection, and bonus calculation. Integration tests for user activity detection, wallet updates, and notification triggers. Manual testing for user experience of seeing streak count and receiving bonuses.

    - **Special Considerations:** Thoroughly test various streak scenarios (e.g., consecutive days, missed days, multiple logins in a day). Test milestone awards at exact breakpoints. Rigorous security testing to prevent fraudulent streak manipulation or bonus awards.
