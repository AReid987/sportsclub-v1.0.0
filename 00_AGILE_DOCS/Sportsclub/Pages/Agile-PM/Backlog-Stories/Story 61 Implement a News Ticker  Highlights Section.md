# Story 6.1: Implement a News Ticker / Highlights Section

# Story 6.1: Implement a News Ticker / Highlights Section

## Status: Draft

## Story

- As a **Sportsclub user**,

- I want to **view a prominent news ticker or highlights section**,

- so that I can **quickly see key breaking sports news and important event updates.**

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. The system displays a news ticker or highlights section.

2. This ticker/highlights section is present in a persistent header (visible across most of the application).

3. This ticker/highlights section is prominently displayed on the user's main dashboard.

4. This ticker/highlights section is also present on the dedicated news page.

5. The ticker/highlights displays short headlines that link to the full news article content.

6. The ticker/highlights displays key updates (e.g., major score changes, event start times) that link directly to the relevant event page for placing predictions or viewing event details.

7. The content within the news ticker/highlights updates constantly or in near real-time.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Implement backend API endpoint for fetching news ticker/highlights content.

- [ ] Implement frontend UI component for the news ticker/highlights display.

- [ ] Integrate the news ticker component into the persistent header, main dashboard, and dedicated news page.

- [ ] Implement frontend logic for displaying short headlines and key updates.

- [ ] Implement frontend routing/linking to full news articles and relevant event pages.

- [ ] Implement backend logic for constantly updating or pushing news/event highlight content.

- [ ] Integrate with the Content Service to source news articles and event data for highlights.

- [ ] Ensure efficient data transfer for real-time updates.

## Dev Technical Guidance

This story establishes a highly visible and real-time content delivery mechanism. Focus on efficient data sourcing, low-latency updates, and smooth UI integration.

- **Dependency:** This story **depends on Epic 1** for foundational setup. It also implicitly relies on the **Content Service** and **Data Ingestion & Validation Service** (from Component View in Architecture Document) for sourcing news and event data.

- **Data Sourcing:** News articles will be sourced via the **Content Service**. Key updates and scores will come from the **Data Ingestion & Validation Service**. Refer to the "External Data Scraping Sources (Agent-Powered)" in the Architecture Document's "API Reference" for potential sourcing mechanisms.

- **Data Models:** Refer to the `NewsArticle` and `SportingEvent` data models in the Architecture Document for schema definitions.

- **Real-time/Near Real-time:** The AC states content must update "constantly or in near real-time". This implies using WebSockets or a similar push mechanism from the backend to the frontend for these updates, aligning with the "Real-time Comms" tech stack selection.

- **Performance:** Optimize frontend rendering for smooth scrolling or animation of the ticker, and backend API endpoints for fast content delivery. Refer to "Performance Requirements" in NFRs (PRD).

- **Security:** Ensure secure data transfer and display of news content, preventing injection vulnerabilities. Adhere to "Security Best Practices" in the Architecture Document.

- **UI/UX:** The ticker should be prominent but not intrusive. Consider visual hierarchy from the UI/UX Specification for placement and styling.
