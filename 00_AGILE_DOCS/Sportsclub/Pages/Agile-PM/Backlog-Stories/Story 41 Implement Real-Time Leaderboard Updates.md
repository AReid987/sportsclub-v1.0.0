# Story 4.1: Implement Real-Time Leaderboard Updates

# Story 4.1: Implement Real-Time Leaderboard Updates

## Status: Draft

## Story

- As a **Sportsclub user**,

- I want the **leaderboard rankings to update in real-time as prediction outcomes are processed**,

- so that I can **always see the most current competitive standings and track my progress instantaneously.**

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. The system displays a leaderboard ranking users based on their current virtual coin totals for the active month.

2. For each ranked player, the leaderboard displays at minimum: username, avatar (if available), current coin total, and rank number.

3. Users can easily see their own current rank on the leaderboard, potentially via a "sticky" or highlighted display of their position.

4. Leaderboard rankings update in real-time or near real-time as users' coin totals change due to prediction outcomes.

5. The system uses WebSockets to push leaderboard updates to connected clients.

6. The leaderboard displays correct rankings even with high concurrency of coin changes.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Implement backend service/logic for updating leaderboard data in real-time.

- [ ] Integrate with Prediction Engine Service (or Coin Transaction events) to receive immediate updates on coin changes.

- [ ] Implement WebSocket server endpoint for leaderboard data push.

- [ ] Implement frontend WebSocket client to receive leaderboard updates.

- [ ] Design and implement real-time leaderboard UI to display rankings.

- [ ] Implement frontend logic to update leaderboard UI dynamically upon receiving WebSocket data.

- [ ] Implement logic to prominently display the current user's rank.

- [ ] Ensure efficient data transfer for leaderboard updates over WebSockets.

## Dev Technical Guidance

This story is crucial for the real-time competitive experience. Focus on low-latency data processing, efficient WebSocket implementation, and performant UI rendering for dynamic updates.

- **Dependency:** This story **depends on Story 3.3: Automate Prediction Outcome Processing & Award Winnings** (for triggering coin changes). It also relies on **Epic 1** (foundational setup) for infrastructure, and **Story 2.3: Create Virtual Wallet and Display Balance** for accurate coin totals.

- **Real-time Communication:** WebSockets (e.g., using Socket.IO) are the chosen technology for real-time communication. Refer to the "Real-time Communication" section in the Architecture Document.

- **Data Models:** Refer to the `LeaderboardEntry` data model in the Architecture Document for schema definitions. Also, `User` and `VirtualWallet` models are relevant.

- **Backend Logic:** The Leaderboard & Prize Service (from Component View) will likely manage the real-time leaderboard data.

- **Performance:** The system needs to efficiently handle high frequency of updates and many concurrent users. Refer to "Performance Requirements" in NFRs for response times and scalability.

- **Security:** Ensure secure WebSocket connections and prevent unauthorized data manipulation. Refer to "Security Best Practices."

- **Testing Guidance:**

    - **Approach:** Unit tests for backend ranking logic. Integration tests for WebSocket setup and data push from backend services. Performance testing for concurrent updates and high user load. Manual UI testing for real-time display and user's sticky rank.

    - **Special Considerations:** Verify low latency of updates. Test under heavy load to ensure real-time performance.
