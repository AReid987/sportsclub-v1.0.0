- Which data points are significant when predicting the winner of a sporting event?

- Which dependencies exist between metrics?

- Which data points are irrelevant if any?

- What is the most optimal way to cache this data and their corresponding visualizations? 

    - in order to reuse them for all user queries 

    - To avoid incurring the overhead of many user requests to Inference providers

    - can a KV cache and cosine similarity match data sets and visualizations to queries?

    ‚≠ê Graph RAG, Light RAG, KAG, or CAG may be of use here
