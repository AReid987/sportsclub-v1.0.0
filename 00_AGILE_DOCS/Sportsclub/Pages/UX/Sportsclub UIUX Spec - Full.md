        - for entertainment 

        - and bragging rights with friends. 

    - Values simplicity, 

        - clear game mechanics, 

        - and social interaction 

    - without extensive time commitment or deep sports knowledge.

- **The Data-Driven Learner (Emily):** 

    - Passionate about sports statistics and analytics, aiming to improve predictive skills. 

    - Requires access to comprehensive data, 

        - advanced analytical tools 

            - (including the AI assistant's visualizations and tutoring), 

            - and a challenging environment where informed strategies can lead to success. 

    - Values learning and intellectual stimulation.

- **The Competitive Player (Kevin):** 

    - Driven by the thrill of competition and the desire to win cash prizes and recognition. 

    - Seeks a fast-paced, exciting gameplay experience with high reward potential, 

        - closely monitoring leaderboards and other players' strategies. 

    - Values competition, financial reward, and status.

**Key Usability Goals:** 

We will strive for the following usability goals for Sportsclub:

- Efficiency

- Learnability

- Memorability

- Error Prevention/Recovery

**Core Design Principles:** 

The following principles will guide every design decision for Sportsclub:

1. **Clarity & Simplicity:** 

    - Every element should have a clear purpose and be easy to understand. 

        - Avoid clutter and unnecessary complexity, 

            - allowing users to focus on core actions like placing predictions or viewing key data.

2. **Immediate Feedback & Responsiveness:** 

    - The system should always provide clear and instant feedback to user actions, 

        - ensuring they understand the outcome of their interactions. 

    - Visual and interactive elements should feel highly responsive and dynamic.

3. **Data-Driven Empowerment:** 

    - Present sports data, user performance metrics, and AI insights 

        - in a way that truly empowers users to make informed decisions and learn. 

    - Visualizations should be insightful and actionable, not just decorative.

4. **Community & Connection First:** 

    - Design elements should actively foster a sense of belonging and connection. 

    - Community features (forums, chats) should be inviting, easy to use, 

        - and encourage active participation, 

        - making users feel part of a shared experience.

5. **Excitement & Reward:** 

    1. The UI should visually convey the excitement of competition and the thrill of potential rewards.

    2. Gamified elements, leaderboards, and prize notifications should be engaging and motivating.

### Navigation Structure

The navigation strategy for Sportsclub will prioritize intuitive access to core functionalities, adapting to the user's device.

### **Primary Navigation:**

#### **Mobile:** 

- A persistent **bottom tab bar** will provide quick access to core sections.

#### **Desktop:** 

- A **sidebar** will serve as the primary navigation element.

#### **All Platforms:** 

- A **persistent top header** will also be present, likely for global actions or branding.

- The most critical sections consistently accessible via primary navigation will include: 

    - **Home (Dashboard),** 

    - Leaderboard, 

    - Wallet, 

    - and Events.

### **Secondary Navigation:**

- Sub-navigation or contextual menus will be utilized within specific sections, such as:

    #### **User Profile / Wallet Management:** 

    - For accessing distinct areas like Account Settings or Subscription Management.

    #### **Event Listings:** 

    - For filtering or sorting options.

### **Contextual Navigation:**

- **Breadcrumbs** and other contextual navigation elements will be implemented, 

    - especially for deeper pages 

        - (e.g., specific news articles, forum posts, or detailed player profiles),

    - to help users understand their current location within the application's hierarchy 

        - and easily navigate back.

- Sportsclub is committed to building an inclusive and accessible platform. 

- All UI/UX design and implementation must adhere to the following 

    - accessibility standards and principles:

#### **Target Compliance:** 

- **WCAG 2.1 Level AA**. 

    - Designs and implementations will be rigorously evaluated against these guidelines 

        - to ensure a high level of accessibility.

#### **Semantic HTML:** 

- Prioritize the use of appropriate and semantic HTML5 elements 

    - to convey meaning and structure, 

        - aiding assistive technologies.

#### **ARIA Implementation:** 

- For custom UI components where native HTML semantics are insufficient, 

    - appropriate ARIA 

        - (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) 

        - attributes (roles, states, properties) 

        - will be used to enhance accessibility 

            - and provide necessary information to assistive technologies.

- Referencing standards like the ARIA Authoring Practices Guide (APG) 

    - will be crucial for specific implementations.

#### **Keyboard Navigation:** 

- All interactive elements (buttons, links, form fields, navigation items, etc.) 

    - must be fully operable 

    - and focusable via keyboard-only navigation.

- Focus order must be logical and intuitive.

#### **Screen Reader Compatibility:** 

- Ensure all visual information and interactive elements are programmatically accessible 

    - and correctly interpreted by screen readers. 

- This includes providing meaningful `alt` text for images, 

    - proper ARIA attributes for custom components, 

    - and clear headings.

#### **Color Contrast:** 

- Maintain sufficient color contrast ratios for 

    - text and interactive elements against their backgrounds 

        - to ensure readability for users with low vision.

#### **Focus Management:** 

- Implement clear visual focus indicators for all interactive elements. 

- Manage focus appropriately for 

    - dynamic content changes, 

    - modals, 

    - and route transitions

        - to maintain user context.

#### **Error Identification & Feedback:** 

- Error messages should be clear, concise, and programmatically associated with 

    - the relevant input fields, 

        - guiding users on how to correct issues.

## Responsiveness

- Sportsclub is designed as a **mobile-first responsive web application**, 

    - ensuring an optimal user experience across a range of devices, including 

        - smartphones, 

        - tablets, 

        - and desktop computers.

#### **Breakpoints:** 

- The design will adapt to the following primary breakpoints, 

    - which will be defined in pixels within the styling framework 

        - (e.g., Tailwind CSS configuration):

#### **Mobile (Default):** 

- For screens up to approximately `640px` wide. 

- This will be the base design.

#### **Tablet (Medium):** 

- For screens from `641px` to `1024px` wide.

#### **Desktop (Large):** 

- For screens wider than `1024px`.

### **Adaptation Strategy:**

#### **Mobile-First Design:** 

- All components and layouts will be designed and built with 

    - mobile screens as the primary consideration, 

    - ensuring core functionality and readability on smaller devices.

#### **Fluid Grids & Flexible Images:** 

- The layout will utilize fluid grids and flexible images 

    - to adapt gracefully to varying screen widths.

#### **Content Prioritization:** 

- On smaller screens, content will be prioritized 

    - to ensure critical information and actions 

        - are easily accessible, 

        - potentially reflowing or hiding less essential elements.

#### **Navigation Adaptation:** 

- Navigation elements will adapt to the breakpoint 

    - (e.g., bottom tab bar on mobile, 

    - sidebar on desktop, 

    - as discussed in Information Architecture).

#### **Component Behavior:** 

- UI components will adjust their 

    - size, 

    - layout, 

    - and interaction patterns 

        - as appropriate for each breakpoint to maintain usability and visual appeal.
